Or, to put it another way, the informativeness of a data point; the amount of novel information contained in the data point.\n\nKyle Vogt also says some interesting stuff on automatic labelling or auto-labelling ([22:27](https://youtu.be/O6t7P1a7dyY?t=22m27s)):\n\n>...basically, what I mean is you take the human labelling step out of the loop. ... There's a lot of things you can infer from the way a vehicle drives. If it didn't make any mistakes, then you can sort of implicitly assume a lot of things were correct about the way that vehicle drove. ... When the AVs are basically driving correctly and the people in the car are saying 'you did a good job', that, to me, is a very rich source of information. \n\nKyle Vogt's statements about dataset entropy/diversity and automatic labelling seem applicable to Tesla.\n\nFor video clips that are labelled by humans (for use in fully supervised learning for computer vision), the benefit of Tesla's fleet driving ~700 million miles a month is the entropy, diversity, and rarity of the training examples that can be automatically flagged by various signals. Those signals include:\n\n* deep learning-based queries (e.g. look for [bikes mounted on vehicles](https://youtu.be/33K3id2xNAE))\n* [novelty detection](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/novelty-detection)\n* [uncertainty estimation](https://www.inovex.de/blog/uncertainty-quantification-deep-learning/)\n* human interventions (e.g. when Autopilot is disengaged)\n* disagreements between the trajectory taken by a human driver and the trajectory generated by the software planner (e.g. [Aurora](https://slideslive.com/38916646/the-promise-and-challenge-of-ml-in-selfdriving) uses this as a signal)\n\nIn other words, using a combination of human signals and machine signals to trigger uploads, a higher quantity of data leads to a higher quality of dataset. \n\nWith automatic labelling, Tesla can leverage a vast amount of data for: \n\n1. Weakly supervised learning for computer vision ([this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01238.pdf) gives an example of one way this might work)\n\n 2. Self-supervised (a.k.a. unsupervised) learning for [prediction](https://youtu.be/A44hbogdKwI)\n\n3. [Imitation learning](https://youtu.be/v5l-jPsAK7k) (and possibly reinforcement learning) for planning\n\nThere may also be some potential for [self-supervised learning for computer vision](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1193771034962325504?s=21), but I don't yet really understand how that would work. This is a topic I'd like to learn more about if anyone can suggest any beginner-friendly reading on this.\n\nSo, I interpret Kyle Vogt as agreeing, in principle, with the idea that more real world driving data is better and that human labour requirements don't negate the usefulness of more data.\n\nSome folks have argued that Tesla's ~100-1000x quantity of real world miles relative to competitors is useless because more data is only valuable if you pay people to label it and it's just too expensive for Tesla to label much more data than anyone else. Kyle Vogt seems to disagree, in principle, with folks who say that.\n\nI'm not an expert on machine learning or autonomous vehicles, so I could be wrong about any of this.

Self driving cars.", "selftext": "Well, since self-driving cars are really starting to take off, i thought i would make a list of the things im MOST excited about self-driving cars.\n\n1. No tickets EVER! The car won't speed, or ever hit anything so traffic cops will become non existant, no one will ever get a traffic ticket and that will free up SO MUCH MONEY to build charging stations and greenspaces by having to pay less police officers just to do \"traffic patrol\" or whatever. Dont know about where you live, but rookie cops here make 85k a year. So having a couple hundred less of them will save TONS of money.\n\n2. Drinking! Many laws will change, for example, yes, drink behind the wheel, why not? Youre not driving. No more DUIS!\n\n3. People are terrible drivers. Putting liability on the auto manufacturer means the cars have to be safe.\n\n4. NO CAR INSURANCE! Because car insurance covers the PERSON driving the car, and self driving cars won't have any accidents, there will be no need for car insurance as the very small number of \"accidents\" will be totally covered by the manufacturer. Since it is caused by their tech, just like the takata airbag malfunctions were paid for by the manufacturer. Also, this means WAY LESS insurance agents who i have always felt were overpaid for what they do. AWESOME!\n\n5. SAFETY! NO ONE WILL EVER DIE IN A CAR WRECK AGAIN. lets face it. SDCs are computers and thus MUCH smarter than people. Faster reaction time, etc. Every car accident in the world is caused by some kind of driver error and computers dont EVER MAKE ERRORS! does your calculator ever make a math mistake? NO! And thats what SDCs will do. No more accidents at all. \n\n6. Mentioned earlier drinking, but really, do whatever you want behind the wheel, play on your phone, gameboy, sleep, eat, put on makeup, have sex, watch tv, get dressed for work. All while getting where youre going FASTER AND SAFER.\n\n7. LESS CARS ON ROAD! Well, once all the normies who drive regular cars die in wrecks (because of course they will, they dont have a robot driver) there will be way less cars on the road and everything will be WAY safer, because it's all robots.\n\n8. PAVES THE WAY FOR WIDESPREAD BODY ACCEPTANCE. Well, along with being too lazy to drive, most will be too lazy to do other things and the world will turn into a WALL-E movie scenario where everyone is lazy and overweight. THIS IS THE BEST PART because it will make our whole society more accepting, since EVERYONE will be fat. I know i spend most of my disposable income on food, so once i have to pay less taxes for traffic police and no insurance, I'll have a couple hundred a month to dump into doritos and mountain dew, which is anyone's dream life. \n\nSo, what is everyone else excited about?", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "due100", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/due100/what_are_you_most_excited_about_self_driving_cars/", "author": "Unsub2309", "children_name": ["acefox16", "PFTCommenting", "Cunninghams_right", "Talzon70", "whispermonkey", "designgrit", "None", "michelework", "WeldAE", "jupiterkansas", "Freeewheeler", "leeta0028", "vicegripper", "rileyoneill", "arldyalrdy", "rimalp", "alexander_zero", "rileyoneill", "SiestaKeyJim"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 246, "num_comments": 93, "title": "Tesla Autopilot Drives Straight Towards Concrete Barrier on Highway", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "du2bnz", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/du2bnz/tesla_autopilot_drives_straight_towards_concrete/", "author": "leeta0028", "children_name": ["SconiGrower", "M4ximili4n", "DoktorSleepless", "overhypedtech", "RamzFanz", "scubawankenobi", "kbaltimore22", "Squez360", "ragamufin", "eetzameetbawl", "cash_invalidation", "eyeemache", "ECrispy", "pointclouds", "Heaney555", "drewsiferr", "smallfried", "mslavescu", "ilikepancakez", "Roboserg", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 16, "num_comments": 36, "title": "Why do self driving cars not have a light to signal AP is on?", "selftext": "This would notify traffic to be somewhat cautious", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dtzzom", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dtzzom/why_do_self_driving_cars_not_have_a_light_to/", "author": "Testkill", "children_name": ["Anonymicex", "michelework", "ch00f", "NoTimeForInfinity", "bradtem", "tallman2", "ciel_lanila", "moronmonday526", "rydan", "How_Do_You_Crash", "JacobHSR", "Autonomous-Driving", "bartturner", "rimalp", "XxGas-Cars-SuckxX", "thuktun"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 11, "num_comments": 17, "title": "When/if to go long GOOG?", "selftext": "I generally only invest in index funds, but now that Waymo recently has truly driverless on the streets and the factory ready to start delivering cars, I took a small position in GOOG to try to capture some of the Waymo value before it is accounted for.

SDCs have a sexy futuristic reputation that could excite mayors and citizens and get them to look past the bad reputation that buses have. so, if SDCs can be cool enough to convince cities to do what transit planners already want to do, there is a lot of potential there. it's also likely that SDC companies would offer to run the system with less government subsidy than buses in order to get their foot in the door, so it could be money-saving for a city also. once you have smaller \"buses\" you can start doing things like running every 5th van as an \"express\" that skips all but the busiest/transfer stops.\n\nto me, it seems like an all-around win. bus riders get MUCH better service, transit planners can get transit corridors, mayors get lower budgets and cool tech to look progressive, and SDC companies get a nice walled-garden that they can curate to reduce edge-cases while they develop. as SDC tech gets better, the SDC companies can move from totally isolates streets to ones that have \"bus lanes\" and fixed, easy routes. then eventually city-wide operation.\n\nI don't know of any companies advocating that kind of operation, though there might be a couple. why is this not a more common concept?", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dqpul4", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dqpul4/why_so_little_talk_about_sdc_corridors/", "author": "Cunninghams_right", "children_name": ["cash_invalidation", "JacobHSR", "missingskyscrapers", "AMSolar", "DublinCheezie", "dalinks", "Ambiwlans"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 443, "num_comments": 28, "title": "With the rise of self driving vehicles, it's only a matter of time.", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dq9l8d", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dq9l8d/with_the_rise_of_self_driving_vehicles_its_only_a/", "author": "LiteVolition", "children_name": ["Yasea", "driesenga", "Why_T", "NilsTillander", "mbehl", "WizeAdz", "EVRider81", "DrElectrons", "norsurfit", "AbsoluteZeroK", "ExtremelyQualified", "Pattycakes_wcp", "mux2000", "borisst", "zzyzx000"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 72, "num_comments": 52, "title": "Hailing a driverless ride in a Waymo", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dq6gxn", "permalink": "/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dq6gxn/hailing_a_driverless_ride_in_a_waymo/", "author": "bladerskb", "children_name": ["WeldAE", "Mattsasa", "michelework", "bladerskb", "bladerskb", "Craqhaid", "Mattsasa", "myDVacct", "AtomGalaxy", "vicegripper", "thebruns"]}, {"subreddit": "SelfDrivingCars", "score": 0, "num_comments": 48, "title": "Is there any concern for emergent consciousness?", "selftext": "I know this sounds silly, but please here me out.

It's actually pretty close. Here\u2019s an in depth review from a Tesla owner.", "selftext": "DRIVING ASSIST\n\nI recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride \"S\" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.\n\nComing from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the /u/thestraightpipes review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the \"best lane keep of any car they've driven this year\", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.\n\nThe two features I'm specifically interested in are the \"Lane Following Assist (LFA)\" and the \"Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)\". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.\n\nTHE SYSTEM IN USE\n\nAfter enabling Kia's \"Lane Following Assist\" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the \"Lane Following Assist\" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control. It even surprised me several times by being available on roads I would have never guessed it would work on. Roads that I know Autopilot would be available on, but anyone else's system, not so much (I'm looking at you Nissan Pro Pilot Assist).\n\nKia's \"Lane Following Assist\" works best on perfectly straight, flat roads. This is the environment where confidence in the system is VERY high. It's when you get into one or both of the following circumstances that confidence in the system begins to erode; sharper curves, or shallower curves but at high speeds. At moderate highway speeds 55-65mph most shallow curves are handled well, but often the car would drift over the outer lane line. The system would stay engaged and not give up entirely, EVENTUALLY bringing me back slowly into the lane and near the center. The other circumstance is when road curve at higher speeds. In testing shallow curves at 75-80mph, the \"Lane Following Assist\" system would often give up entirely, turning the steering wheel icon from green to white without notice and I'd have to grip the wheel and turn myself back into the lane. \n\nIn those circumstances the \"Lane Following Assist\" is more of a suggestion of help rather than the great confidence you get with Tesla's autopilot. With Autopilot you can really \"tune out\" and relax to a much greater degree. With the Kia system, it's helping to keep me steered in the center of the lane, but I really REALLY need to keep paying absolute attention. Yet, there were times I kept my hand gripped and at the ready when taking sharper curves on highway ramps and interchanges and the \"Lane Following Assist\" would slow down and turn into the sharper curves in a very surprisingly confident way. I just really never quite knew what to expect it to handle. Most likely after living with the Kia in daily driving for a while I'd start to really know how it works and what it's limitations are. The same happens to a lot of Autopilot users. At first they're frightened of letting go of the wheel. After using it for a year or two, you start to intimately understand it's limitations and strengths and trust it a lot more.\n\nAs far as knowing when the system is engaged and assisting with steering, it's a bit hard to tell. With Autopilot, is very obvious when jesus has taken the wheel. Two pulls on the stalk and you hear the \"bong boom\" chime. When the system turns off, you hear the \"boom bong\" chime. It's very obvious when you're engaging or disengaging the Autopilot system, and visually is very easy to see that it's active on the dashboard screen. With the Kia, the only way to know the steering is being assisted at all is when you feel a slight torque on the wheel while driving, and look down to see the steering wheel icon has turned from white to green. I was really never quite sure when it was active and going to help, or not help, without looking down at the dashboard and taking my eyes off the road. Perhaps the heads up display offered on the top Telluride SX trim with the Prestige package would help keep my eyes closer to the road.\n\nChanging lanes is handled differently in each car. In the Tesla, with their self driving prowess, the cars with the enhanced autopilot or full self driving package handle the lane changes for you when the autopilot system is engaged. Turning on a signal, the car handles the lane change based on the cars around it. In the Kia, when you turn on the signal, the car relies on you to then steer the car out of your lane and into the other lane while the steering assist is temporarily paused. It resumes the \"Lane Following Assist\" a few seconds later once you're centered in the new lane.\n\n\nBETTER OR WORSE?\n\nThree areas where the Kia driving assist system actually performs BETTER than Tesla's Autopilot 2 are: the smoothness of the adaptive cruise control system, when lanes on the highway momentarily widen, and the length of time you can keep your hands off the wheel. \n\nThe adaptive cruise, perhaps by the sluggish nature of the internal combustion engine drivetrain, would accelerate and brake so much more smoothly than any Tesla system I've ever used. It's just so much less twitchy, and far more smooth. It makes for a more relaxed experience in normal use. I didn't get a chance to experience how the Kia system would react to someone cutting in close at the last second, but hopefully that's handled well by the Kia. The only downside to Kia's adaptive cruise control system is one found in almost every other car aside from a Tesla. Once you come to a stop, after a very short amount of time, you have to re-engage the cruise control by tapping the accelerator pedal. In stop and go traffic having to constantly tap the gas pedal can become quite annoying compared to the Tesla, where it can go something like 5 whole minutes at a stop before it'll disengage. Stop and go traffic with Autopilot is more relaxing in this way.\n\nAnother area where the Kia system performed better than Tesla's Autopilot 2 is when lanes would momentarily widen, such as when driving in the far right lane going past an on ramp. In these locations, the road widens slightly and the Autopilot 2 system moves over to the right to remain in the middle of the wider lane, for each and everyone one of these you drive past. To anyone coming onto the on ramp it might appear you're trying to block them out. The Kia system performs much like how Tesla's Autopilot 1 system worked, which was a collaboration between Mobile Eye's camera+chip system, and Tesla's own software. In these circumstances the Kia and the Autopilot 1 system would keep the car steered straight, staying to the left of the momentarily widened lane. It's more like how a person would drive and far more natural. There were also a few moments in my experience with the Kia when the right lane line would be hard to make out or visually non existent, and the Kia system remained engaged confidently. There were also a few times when lane lines would be hard to make out at all on the freeway and the Kia system remained engaged like Autopilot would. Impressed!\n\nThe last area where the Kia system is better is, as pointed out in the Straight Pipes review, you can keep your hands off the steering wheel for a shockingly long amount of time in ideal conditions. Slow or stop-and-go traffic on long roads and highways is where Kia's system really shines, should you want to keep your hands off the wheel. Autopilot is very adamant about keeping your hand on the wheel, providing just a little bit of weight on one side or the other. It varies depending on your speed, but taking your hands off the Tesla steering wheel for more than around 10 seconds, the car would prompt you to put your hands back on. Nissan's Pro Pilot Assist is even worse in my experience. I didn't push the time limits of the Kia system, but it allowed for more hands off time that I personally would ever need, such as taking a two-handed sip of water from a water bottle, or grabbing a napkin from the glove box.\n\nOne thing I didn't get a chance to test was Kia's \"Highway Driving Assistant (HDA)\". It's found in the upper trim levels of the Telluride and from what I understand it uses the GPS/navigation system data just like Tesla's autopilot to know the speed limit of the road you're on and will adjust your cruise control speed to match the changes in speed limits. Though I like this feature in the Tesla, I've also found it to be limiting on some country back roads and farm roads where you want to be driving maybe a little over the speed limit to keep with the flow of traffic and not be holding anyone back. Autopilot will only ever let you go 5mph over the limit of the road you're on and sometimes that's annoying on those kinds of roads. Flat, wide open, no pedestrians around, and most people driving in front and behind driving 10mph over the limit. Perfect conditions for autopilot to keep the monotony of that road at bay, yet I won't use it because it limits my speed more than I'd like.\n\nAnother condition I didn't get to experience in the Kia was stopped car detection. In Tesla's case, a few high profile incidents have occurred involving semi trucks or fire trucks stopped on the highway and the car did not detect the stationary object. This is something that ALL cars from ALL manufacturers with radar+camera systems struggle with. You're approaching at high speed and the car in front of you suddenly moves over and you're faced with a stopped vehicle or object. Does the car react in time? The Tesla does an ok job MOST of the time.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe key feeling I get here with the Kia system, and even some of my experiences with Nissan's Pro Pilot, is inconsistency. I can never quite tell, at least in my short 24 hours with the Kia system, when it's going to give up on me or when it's going to push through and really provide steering assist I can rely on. Tesla's autopilot is still the gold standard in reducing the stress load on the driver on the highway, really providing a strong sense of confidence and predictability that most other systems are still lacking. I haven't tried BMW's new system found in their updated 3 series and X5, but this is the closest anyone's gotten to Autopilot and it works well enough that should I ever want the very excellent Kia Telluride or Hyundai Palisade, I'd feel VERY at home in Los Angeles traffic with their system.

There are also a ton of commuters who won't use a self driving car.\"\n\n\"a horde of self-driving taxis would actually be extremely wasteful and crowded. For example, with a lack of space and parking, they would have to continue driving around on streets 24/7, all night, even with no passengers.\n\nMore waste, more congestion. A well-built public (mass-)transportation system will always be superior. In general, well-built public systems are more efficient than their alternatives.\"\n\nare we really just a bunch of 'libertarian-dimwits' here?

I want this post to be the final word on why this is wrong.\n\n1. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the US.  Not counting taxis, and other types of drivers, people who work in repair and maintenance and sales, and you driving yourselves. That's a great deal of labor to be saved. \n2. The SDC networks will employ hundreds of thousands of people and it will still be at least 2 orders of magnitude less labor. If I had to guess is driving related jobs go from about 30 million to 300k. \n3. SDCs will roll out market by market. Each market will have thousands of cars, they will need buildings for maintenance and repair, fleet operations personal, etc... So having some folks working on keeping the map up to date is a drop in the bucket. \n4. Also doing the HD mapping before launching in a market isn't harder than finding a space, allocating the vehicles, hiring maintenance and operations crews. Hiring and training will take months, HD map, much easier. \n5. There are 40k zip codes in the US. How many people per zip code does it take to maintain an HD map? 1, maybe less, maybe a 1/2 or a third. NYC has 145 zip codes. Do you think 145 people can't be hired to manage the NYC map? So I'd put the ceiling on map maintenance labor at 20k to 40k people. How is that not scalable? How is that less scalable than having a huge maintenance facility in every market?\n6. Just to give you a comparison. Walmart has 4700 stores in the US. They manage inventory and stocking just fine. They manage a labor force of hundreds of thousands. So does amazon, home depot, Dominos pizza. Do you think SDC is a smaller opportunity than Walmart, 9% of us Retail sales? In the real world lots of business are operating at this scale. \n7. I have no answer to the question of is mapping necessary. But is it scalable? Yes, easily, laughably so. \n8. Eventually, lots of the mapping updates can be automated. That is a business optimization that won't be worth doing until you reach scale of deployment. This is the same issue with value engineering sensor suites (Lidar vs Cameras).
