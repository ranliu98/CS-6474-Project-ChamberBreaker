I‚Äôm not saying Apple has never listened or take costumer feedback to heart, but I do believe this is the year where people will look back as Apple actually (consistently) listening to its costumers‚Äîfrom lowering prices in the iPhone 11 and HomePod, to bringing massive battery life/camera upgrades to the iPhone family (that people have been asking), to the redesign of the Mac Pro and re-entering the Display Market with the Pro XDR, and fixing (most) of the issues of the MacBook family with the recent 16 inch MacBook Pro, updating the iPad mini (it wasn‚Äôt updated in 4 years and it finally happened) and releasing the AirPods Pro (people have been asking for in-ear ear buds and noise cancellation for a while; it happened). While some seem like obvious steps and some shouldn‚Äôt have taken so long, I really think Apple is starting to take costumer feedback to heart, even if they don‚Äôt admit their mistakes outright. I think this is probably the best year for Apple in a while.",apple,Opinion: 2019 will be remembered as the year where Apple listened,278,"['once your entire laptop line becomes an internet ragememe, what other choice do you have?', 'They had to listen, consumers have the money. This was the year they finally started reversing some terrible product and pricing decisions. Based on losing consumers in several key markets and ultimately $$.', 'They got me to switch from Android with their new camera and a lower cost', ""Catalina doesn't really fit in this narrative."", '2019. Johnny Ive departs. Apple backs down from overzealous and dogmatic design decisions. These two things are not unrelated.', 'I‚Äôm just glad iTunes is dead.', 'To be fair, the probably listened last year but could only implement those changes this year', 'Don‚Äôt they start planning devices years before actually selling them? So realistically something like 2017 or maybe even earlier was when Apple started listening I guess.', 'They didn‚Äôt listen. They kept raising prices until they started to price themselves out of the market, now they are dialing back.', 'I think little if any of this was a ""listening to customer feedback"" and then delivering what customers wanted as opposed to course corrections and natural product evolution.\n\niPhone: Apple will always want to improve the battery and the camera.  It\'s not like as if Apple read the feedback comments and said, ""oh, this year let\'s add X more to the battery"".  Instead it\'s a question of constantly improving the efficiency of all of the components which improves battery life.  \n\nMac mini:  Apple has long refresh periods with it and the scheduling appears to have more to do with component changes.  So on any given year, if things like the CPU can simply be swapped out for a refresh, they will.  If the new CPUs require changes in space/cooling/power, then there will likely be a longer wait until either different CPUs come out or Apple is willing to do a more substantial upgrade.\n\nAirPods: This seems pretty typical of Apple... release a basic, every-person version of a product sooner and then work on perfecting the features that would go into the ""Pro"" version of the product like noise cancellation, which was an obvious feature, but one that requires more expense and that Apple wasn\'t really late on (considering the form factor).\n\nMac Pro: Apple got ""boxed in"" on their old (trash can) design.  They engineered something having learned from their mistakes.  Sure, there was a hell of a lot of loud feedback, but in the end, they produced the product that they wanted to produce which was very much a PRO product meant *only* for high end professional use.  This is a opposed to the feedback a lot of people were giving, that they very much didn\'t listen to with the Pro or the mini and that was to give us something that would compete with the hackintoshes... a much less expensive, easy to upgrade and expand box.  I\'m not saying Apple didn\'t make the right business decision or that high end PROs aren\'t going to be happy with it, but Apple clearly didn\'t listen to the numerous voices wanting something that was ""pro"" in the other sense of the term.\n\niPad mini: This upgrade reminds me of the late iPod updates.  It was upgraded not because Apple saw that the product had a future, but rather they needed to do a refresh for the smaller number of people where this model makes sense... mostly enterprise use.  I wouldn\'t expect the mini to now suddenly be upgraded frequently, but instead have infrequent updates lacking some of the higher-end product features. \n\nMacBook Pro 16: The keyboard was something they\'ve been working on each year since 2015.  I do think they listened to feedback when it came to the escape key, but much of what makes the 16 such an improvement has to do with knowing that the new CPUs needed better power/cooling and other component considerations.  They ignored (for better or for worse depending on your preference) feedback regarding bringing back ports, slots, MagSafe, user replaceable/upgradable components, etc...', 'True for most hardware, but I can‚Äôt say I agree with the software. iOS 13 has given me nothing but problems.', 'The esc key was an example only. Give us the option for a real keyboard. I‚Äôll pay more for it. That damn Touch Bar is a pita on my work computer:(', '$999 pro stand, no slack in crossing the $1,000 threshold, they may be listening but they‚Äôre charging a lot for it. And only one of the examples I listed can be called ‚Äúworth the price tag‚Äù.', 'Good post, overall, but AirPods Pro were in the pipeline since day 1. Apple has always had earbuds and IEMs.\n\nI noticed zero consumer pull on that. \n\nThe other things- noticeable consumer dissatisfaction for way too long. \n\nAirPods IEMs, nobody was worried about and they came timely still. And we‚Äôre always part of their lineup.', 'Or you could say .... post Jony Ive era.', 'More id say valve has listened', 'It‚Äôs also the year that Jony Ive left Apple and then all of a sudden all Apple products are much more usable.', ""Ok, *who* asked for a thousand dollar display stand?? \n\n**'Fess up!**"", 'I hope the Apple TV remote is next.', 'They ""listened"" on the Mac Pro but there\'s no evidence that ""listening"" influenced anything else they did. The prices of their products went up when NAND/DRAM prices went up, and they went down when they went down. The keyboard on the Macbook Pro could be an example of that, but it\'s more easily explained by the fact that an unreliable keyboard costs them money in warranty service. The fact that the Touch Bar hasn\'t been removed shows that they aren\'t going to just respond to what some cohort of customers say they want. AirPods Pro is a logical extension of the audio engineering work Apple has been doing years and one of their most popular products in years. Getting around to updating some products after years like the iPad Mini or Mac Mini doesn\'t suggest anything has changed, other than they were due for updates.', 'It‚Äôs probably cause they got rid of that dinosaur Jony Ives; the whole butterfly keyboard fiasco he created is an abomination.\n\nSure, he probably still had some say in the designs for the latest products that were released, but they probably slowly relinquished his control over the designs before finally kicking him out.\n\nI expect/hope Apple to continue this trend and start bringing back more functionality over form now that Ives is gone, good riddance.', 'I actually feel the opposite, in this period i feel apple has moved away from their core values that attracted me to their products\n\n2019 and i still cannot upgrade from an iPhone 7+ because the phones available in my price range are all a downgrade. My 7+ has 25% more pixels per inch than the iPhone 11 which has a screen which is a fair bit bigger. Same with the XR. The XS is practically the same price as the 11 pro still. You either spend ¬£1250 on the best phone or pay ¬£800 for something worse than product they released 3 years ago. I remember thinking ~¬£350 was alot for a 3g!\n\nI might use my camera once a day but not for social media and so do not understand the need for 3 huge lenses\n\nI bought an iPhone because it combined my ipod and phone. Now i cant even use headphones and if i do they aren‚Äôt compatible with anything else \n\nAfter having an iPhone since the 3g im on the verge of moving to android.\n\nNo value in upgrades, no improvements that are worth paying ¬£1250 for', 'There‚Äôs a video published last week on The Verge making this exact point.', 'Also most of the new features of ios 13 have been features people jave wonted for a lot of time - dark mode , grouped notification, proper file system etc.', 'Show me an overhauled Siri and the rest of their services division.\n\nShow me Apple smart speakers at different price points, Siri Support licensed to 3rd party speakers.\n\nShow me competitive answers to the top offerings from their biggest rivals.\n\nShow me the severed head of whichever moron pushed the Touchbar through.\n\nShow me reliable software and hardware with all the advertised features, shipping on time.\n\nShow me Tim Cook (and the rest of the board) stepping down and appointing a CEO and new executives with backbone and vision.\n\nThen, perhaps, they are listening.']","Opinion: 2019 will be remembered as the year where Apple listened Just my opinion.

Instead Apple killed the soul and practicality of the machine and killed off people‚Äôs favourite Mac for a 13‚Äù version of the neutered MacBook', ""It's important to note that all of the above tests represent burst performance but not sustained performance. The 2018 MacBook Pro initially launched with serious throttling issues, but Apple released a firmware update that quickly stabilized things, with only a modest expected amount of throttling. When we tested this machine by doing heavy duty work in Final Cut and other programs while monitoring the CPU and GPU, we encountered no significant throttling under sustained heavy load. There are still some limitations in terms of just how crazy Apple can go with the components it puts in this chassis, but it looks like we're at a sweet spot here. The components in this machine perform consistently and well even over fairly long periods of time.\n\nWhat I find odd is that the Del xps has the same problems, and actually worse, but it doesn't seem to get as much hate."", 'I‚Äôm holding out until they release a MacBook with a Model M keyboard', ""I honestly think the 16 inch is the best keyboard Apple's made.

***PERFORMANCE:*** Geekbench 5/Cinebench/Unigine Heaven/Black Magic/Crystal Disk Mark

Geekbench 5 (CPU):

* Average score from 5 results SL3 15: **871 (Single-Core)/3164 (Multi-Core)**
* 16-inch MBP: There aren't any benchmarks as of the day I'm posting this, so I'll use this [video](https://youtu.be/gGLqcX3Iaes?t=342) and my result as a reference for now:

Cinebench 20 average of 5 (CPU):

* SL3 15: 1987
* 16-inch MBP: 2649

Black Magic and Crystal Disk Mark (SSD):

MBPs always had the fastest SSDs and it's no different here. Here are two tests done by laptopmag: [Test 1](https://prnt.sc/pzq9zo)///[Test 2.](https://prnt.sc/pzqes4) The file [copy test speed](https://prnt.sc/q0rx0n) is surprisingly low on the SL3. I also got very slow results on CDM:

Unigine Heaven 4 (GPU):

* SL3: 25.1 FPS average
* 16-inch MBP: 48.3 FPS average
* A GPU comparison from [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/GeForce-GTX-1650-Laptop-vs-Vega-11_9828_8470.247598.0.html) of the Vega 11 vs NVIDIA GTX 1650 that's slower than the 5300M. The GTX 1650 beats the Vega 11. Thus we can conclude that the 5300M beats the Vega 11 since it also beats the GTX 1650 tested here with a [gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogd5p8UZdR8) comparison (5300M vs GTX 1650).

To conclude, I was very surprised by how underwhelming the performance was from the SL3----from the CPU to the GPU and to even the SSD speed. At the same price, the difference in performance shouldn't be this substantial, not mentioning the SL3 also has worse thermal cooling (reached 105 degrees!!!)--but you do get double the RAM I guess?

***DISPLAY:***

The highest I hit on the SL3 15's 2K display is 367 nits, which is about average, and 466 nits on my 16"" MBP, which is great. The display quality between the 16"" MBP and the SL3 is also huge. With only a 93% sRGB color range, **you will not be able to do any professional work relying on color--this laptop is a no go for artists, designers, content creators, video/film, anyone that focuses on color.** The SL3's display is not professional grade. It's fine for media consumption, but if you mainly want to use it for browsing/media, there are other laptops with better/similar displays and performance for almost half the price--or even the intel i5 version of the SL3.

The 3K display on the MBP on the other hand is rated as [one of the best](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebook-Displays-As-Reviewed-By-Notebookcheck.120541.0.html) laptop displays. It has 100% DCI-P3 and 93% AdobeRGB--the display quality alone is worth 200-$300 compared to the SL3. Another advantage Macs have is their image/text scaling. TLDR, MacOS does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. The reason why many professionals use Macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you‚Äôre working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. It‚Äôll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from MacOS in this case. True Tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency, I would recommend you to turn it off. The 16-inch MBP display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles than the SL3.

Touchscreen/touchbar wise both aren‚Äôt too useful in my opinion. With the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links I guess? But most of the time it‚Äòs really awkward/annoying because I have to reach further from my keyboard when I‚Äôm working‚Äîwhich slows down my workflow‚Äîwhen I can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. I also find that besides the scrolling here and there, I barely use it. Also, it‚Äôs a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. The touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it‚Äôs actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***BUILD/OTHERS***

Thickness and weight wise, both are about the same (0.57 inch 3.9 pounds SL3/0.64 inch 4.3 pounds MBP). Both are very well-built machines made out of aluminum. But the difference in battery life is significant--up to 4 hours more on the MBP. With normal web browsing at 300 nits, the SL3 lasted 6 hours while the MBP lasted 8 hours and 24 minutes. At 300 nits while working on video/photo editing and some light gaming, the SL3 lasted only 4 hours and 17 minutes. In comparison, my MBP at the same brightness and workflow lasted close to 7 hours. Performance on the SL3 also drops dramatically when it's not plugged in--around 40-65% depending. The MBP on the other hand stays roughly the same (less than 15% drop) without being plugged in. As a result of constant charging for performance, the SL3‚Äôs battery will deteriorate faster in the long run. This also happened with many of my windows laptops. My 2017 Dell XPS has already dropped by roughly 50%, whereas my 2016 MBP lasts me 3 hours more.

The keyboard and track-pad on the SL3 however, was a pleasant surprise. Although it‚Äôs still clear that the MBP's track-pad is still a tier above every other laptop, what the SL3 has to offer is very good--one of the best from the windows side of things. The keyboard on the SL3 is also great, although still not quite in the same tier as ThinkPads and the new magic keyboard on the 16""--but Microsoft is getting very close. Audio wise (speakers/mic), the 16"" wins hands down in this area as well. MBPs has always had the best audio, but the 16"" takes that a step further and makes the older gen MBPs sound outdated, even though they had the best speakers already. The SL3 however, has a better port selection and doubles the RAM. But weirdly it doesn't have any thunderbolt 3 ports, whereas the 16"" MBP has 4. In order to get the same ports, you'd need to spend $50 more for a port hub on the MBP--then again, the extra thunderbolts are very useful for professional workflows. And although Microsoft claims their SSDs are ""removable"", they make the process [a pain in the ass](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-ssd-repair-upgrade) to do so. But nevertheless, it's still a step forward from Apple's soldered on SSDs.

To conclude, the Surface Laptop 3 does a great job in terms of feel and design----but the performance (CPU/GPU/SSD speed), display quality, and battery life you get when compared to the 16"" MBP at the same price is almost laughable. At the same price, the 16"" MBP beats the SL3 in literally every category besides storage/ram amount. I understand that you don't have the same ports, but you can spend $50 more to get a port hub and get MORE ports than what the SL3 offers--aka 4 extra thunderbolt 3s while getting way better performance/display/battery/etc.

In terms of professional usage/workflow, it's a no-brainer to get the 16"" MBP. You're essentially scamming and handicapping your own productivity if you buy the SL3. However, if you want a device for average/light use, then I would actually recommend you to get the **13.5-inch/i5 version** of the SL3, or the Dell XPS 13, or a ThinkPad. If you're a designer/artist/in fine arts, then you should definitely get the 13-inch MBP for its top-of-the-line color accuracy/consistency/calibration. Here is more information regarding 4K OLEDs in the **display section** of my [XPS 15 comparison.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dz7ewx/macbook_pro_16_vs_dell_xps_15_7950an_indepth/)

Also, **DO NOT** buy the 13.5"" i7 version of the SL3 even though it has a 10th Gen i7. It might seem inciting, but the thermals/performance is lacking (mainly because of the lower end GPU which also forces more work onto the CPU while in a smaller body). The performance under heavier workloads is sometimes worse than the 15"" version Ryzen 7, and substantially worse than the 16-inch MBP at the same price of $2399. The GPU inside is also an INTEL IRIS PLUS--a downgrade from the AMD RX Vega 11 that's already way behind the 5300M in the MBP.",apple,"Macbook Pro 16"" vs Surface Laptop 3--An-indepth review w/ benchmarks",290,"[""The Surface laptop doesn't have thunderbolt 3, lacks CPU and GPU performance, and has a much smaller battery.\n\nNo idea why anybody would pick the 15 inch surface laptop over MacBook 16 inch"", 'It‚Äôs worth noting that the 3780U is also only 4c/8t despite being an ‚ÄúR7‚Äù, vs 6c/12t in the 9750H.

Apple is no longer an option until they stop soldering RAM/SSD and preventing third-party repairs, and the Surface is going in the right direction with the SSD, what about the RAM? is it soldered or not?

The touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it‚Äôs actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.

***BUILD/OTHERS***

Thickness and weight wise, both are about the same (0.57 inch 3.9 pounds SL3/0.64 inch 4.3 pounds MBP). Both are very well-built machines made out of aluminum. But the difference in battery life is significant--up to 4 hours more on the MBP. With normal web browsing at 300 nits, the SL3 lasted 6 hours while the MBP lasted 8 hours and 24 minutes. At 300 nits while working on video/photo editing and some light gaming, the SL3 lasted only 4 hours and 17 minutes. In comparison, my MBP at the same brightness and workflow lasted close to 7 hours. Performance on the SL3 also drops dramatically when it's not plugged in--around 40-65% depending. The MBP on the other hand stays roughly the same (less than 15% drop) without being plugged in. As a result of constant charging for performance, the SL3‚Äôs battery will deteriorate faster in the long run. This also happened with many of my windows laptops. My 2017 Dell XPS has already dropped by roughly 50%, whereas my 2016 MBP lasts me 3 hours more.

The keyboard and track-pad on the SL3 however, was a pleasant surprise. Although it‚Äôs still clear that the MBP's track-pad is still a tier above every other laptop, what the SL3 has to offer is very good--one of the best from the windows side of things. The keyboard on the SL3 is also great, although still not quite in the same tier as ThinkPads and the new magic keyboard on the 16""--but Microsoft is getting very close. Audio wise (speakers/mic), the 16"" wins hands down in this area as well. MBPs has always had the best audio, but the 16"" takes that a step further and makes the older gen MBPs sound outdated, even though they had the best speakers already. The SL3 however, has a better port selection and doubles the RAM. But weirdly it doesn't have any thunderbolt 3 ports, whereas the 16"" MBP has 4. In order to get the same ports, you'd need to spend $50 more for a port hub on the MBP--then again, the extra thunderbolts are very useful for professional workflows. And although Microsoft claims their SSDs are ""removable"", they make the process [a pain in the ass](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-ssd-repair-upgrade) to do so. But nevertheless, it's still a step forward from Apple's soldered on SSDs.

To conclude, the Surface Laptop 3 does a great job in terms of feel and design----but the performance (CPU/GPU/SSD speed), display quality, and battery life you get when compared to the 16"" MBP at the same price is almost laughable. At the same price, the 16"" MBP beats the SL3 in literally every category besides storage/ram amount. I understand that you don't have the same ports, but you can spend $50 more to get a port hub and get MORE ports than what the SL3 offers--aka 4 extra thunderbolt 3s while getting way better performance/display/battery/etc.

In terms of professional usage/workflow, it's a no-brainer to get the 16"" MBP. You're essentially scamming and handicapping your own productivity if you buy the SL3. However, if you want a device for average/light use, then I would actually recommend you to get the **13.5-inch/i5 version** of the SL3, or the Dell XPS 13, or a ThinkPad. If you're a designer/artist/in fine arts, then you should definitely get the 13-inch MBP for its top-of-the-line color accuracy/consistency/calibration. Here is more information regarding 4K OLEDs in the **display section** of my [XPS 15 comparison.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dz7ewx/macbook_pro_16_vs_dell_xps_15_7950an_indepth/)

Also, **DO NOT** buy the 13.5"" i7 version of the SL3 even though it has a 10th Gen i7. It might seem inciting, but the thermals/performance is lacking (mainly because of the lower end GPU which also forces more work onto the CPU while in a smaller body). The performance under heavier workloads is sometimes worse than the 15"" version Ryzen 7, and substantially worse than the 16-inch MBP at the same price of $2399. The GPU inside is also an INTEL IRIS PLUS--a downgrade from the AMD RX Vega 11 that's already way behind the 5300M in the MBP.",64,1881,29,"[2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 6]","[37, 47, 71, 3, 14, 33, 50, 12, 59, 77, 49, 70, 65, 41, 10, 33, 158, 7, 20, 21, 16, 21, 23, 12, 3, 53, 21, 34, 114]",2.310344827586207,40.48275862068966

This happens especially when you sign up for subscription service. For example, I read some tech articles about the benefit of signing up for Apple TV+ for one free year and I did so on November 1, but decided to cancel today Nov 25. Then I did an audit of how Apple was approaching any payment card I had provided them through the years and I found repeated attempts to charge me for services that I trialed in the past and then cancelled within the trial period. Calling customer service at Apple today the staff told me wildly conflicting stories about when I had cancelled the other trials. One said she could see I cancelled Aug 28 and the other said that I had called Apple on Oct 22--I didn't call Apple on Oct 22 as I was traveling out of the country that day. The customer service agents clearly were making things up and they all refused to let me send them emails of attempted Apple charge attempts. It came out that Apple never has a paperwork trail of when you cancel a subscription that the customer receives or can see. So in my experience Apple staff tried to say that I had failed to cancel services and they went on trying to charge me. They finally said that if a customer takes a screenshot of the act of cancellation they will accept that as evidence. Do not deal with a company that will not send you a notice of when a service is cancelled. Apple does not. Do not deal with a company that I can 100% tried to charge me four times for a service I had very clearly cancelled. I am fully expecting that in November next year Apple will start charging me for Apple TV+ and say I didn't cancel the trial today.

I am planning on using either one for mobile photoshop, video conversions (then export to my main pc), note taking, plain typing.

Could be genuine Apple cable, or other certified cable. Doesn't matter, it just doesn't recognize it. \n\nA couple of years back, I took it into one of these 'genius bars'. First thing the guy did was put it in DFU mode so he could reset it.   Well, THAT didn't work. Seriously, didn't work. It started the reset process, got what it needed from his Mac, and then just gave an error and restarted. He tried this about 3 times, looking all stupid like. Didn't bother to get any other help, just kept on trying the same old failed solution.\n\nAfter about a half hour of this, I gave up, asked what else he could do. he said 'nothing'. It is out of warranty, and out of our hands. Best I can do is give you a deal on a used one and take this in it's place.  That deal ? $450\n\nI took the device, which WAS working, sans charging issue when I brought it into the store back home. When I got home, I had to spend 4 hours trying to get it to recognize something JUST so that I could reformat it and bring it back to life.\n\nTo this day, the device still works, but has to be plugged in constantly. The second it's unplugged, I have to restart it to 'hack' it to at least kind of see the charging cable.\n\nTotally horrible experience. Apple doesn't care about customers any more.

He was a Ge jus, both literally as his job title and very much in the dictionary definition sense.\n\nThis guy was a true whiz when it came to computers. You could ask him anything and he knew how to solve it. An accomplished programmer, a master of networking, there basically was no task too large for him.\n\nHis biggest flaw was that his interpersonal skills needed serious help. He would routinely piss off customers by not being to ‚Äúdumb things down‚Äù enough for them to understand. I was one of the few people in the store who operated even remotely close to his skill level. If he was a 10/10, I was a 6/10, maybe a 7 on some topics. Most of the people we worked with would laugh at him because he‚Äôd talk to them about some technical topic, they wouldn‚Äôt understand, and they‚Äôd tell him to stop being such a dweeb. It didn‚Äôt help that he really had no friends there. We had a lot of great chats. I don‚Äôt know this for sure, but I always figured he was had high-functioning autism or something similar.\n\nHe was in college was he was working at Apple. He didn‚Äôt really see the point of it anymore, because he felt like he was just wasting his time there.\n\nHis mother wrote an email to Steve Jobs explaining her son‚Äòs personality and skill. She said he wanted to drop out and that she couldn‚Äôt change his mind.\n\nI never got to read the letter, but Steve Jobs wrote back to him (remember he worked there so he had an @apple email). He told him he wanted him to stay in school, and that his mother was right. He understood what it was like to feel that way at college but he still thought he should stay and finish.\n\nLong story short, he did end up staying in college because of that email from Steve Jobs.', 'What about when Chrisann Brennan called?', ""Wasn't there a policy that you could get fired for walking up to him and talking to him  in the elevator or whatever? Or is that just a rumor?"", 'Back in the early 80s when getting your own computer was unobtainable for many, I scraped together enough money to take a computer class at a community college.  They really sucked at computers but they time shared accounts to a nearby University\'s mainframe.\n\nI took that account info and went to the university to use their terminals.

The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.

Before throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.  

This combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!

The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.

Before throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.  

This combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!

First off, Ive hasn\'t really ""left"". He created his own design team and Apple is still very much their client. His designs will still be seen in Apple products. Also, Apple takes a long time to plan, design, build, and ship products. Ive leaving to have his own design firm just recently happened. I highly doubt this MBP was created so quickly. It was probably in the pipeline for the past year and half or two. It is a natural advancement of the current MBP line. Apple is giving the user a bigger, better display, better speakers, better battery life, and a better base configuration. \n\nApple will never fully go back on a design decision. I think the return to a better keyboard, or \'Magic Keyboard\', and the return of an ESC key is just because of the massive backlash to the previous MBP\'s. Apple says the ESC key is the #1 request but I doubt it. The #1 request has probably been ""please bring back the old keyboard, get rid of this useless Touch Bar gimmick, and bring back more ports."" Apple refuses to admit the Touch Bar is basically a gimmick at this point, so instead they throw us a bone and bring back the ESC key and market it as a victory for \'Pros\'. They put a better keyboard in it and call it a \'Magic Keyboard\'. They will push onward with USB C everything and the Touch Bar. \n\nI think the real question now is what happens to the 13"" MBP. Logically, it should receive the same treatment. It should get a better display with thinner bezels, a better battery life, the better keyboard, and an ESC key all while increasing the base configuration. \n\nThe best and most surprising thing about the new MBP is that Apple didn\'t price gouge their customers. I was fully expecting this machine to come in at $2999. By replacing the 15"" MBP and keeping the same price points it is really a great laptop. I can\'t even find a windows laptop with the exact same specs at that price, or even close.

(2nd year architecture student)\n\nI\'m currently in my 2nd year of architecture school, and I\'m planning to upgrade my 13"" MacBook Pro 2015 to the new 16"" MacBook Pro. I know I can get much better value with a Windows laptop, but as a 10+ years Mac user, Mac, macOS and being part of the Apple eco-system is a no-brainer for me. Windows is out of the question. :) If I really need to use Windows-only apps like Revit or 3DS Max, I\'m prepared to run Parallels or BootCamp (or even to buy an additional PC in the future).\n\nNow, I\'ve doen some research, including watching 30x40\'s purchase guide on YT, and I\'ve got a pretty good understanding of computers in general, but I wanted to ask for advice here nonetheless. After all, architecture school is still quite new for me.\n\nJust some FYI:\n\nApps I currently use often: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* AutoCAD, Rhino  \n \n* Photoshop  \n \n* Lightroom  \n \n* InDesign  \n \n* some SketchUp  \n \n* Final Cut Pro (not for architecture, but I need to edit video for work+hobby)  \n \n\nApps I\'m planning to use: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Rhino + Grasshopper,   \n \n* Vray (+ other rendering programs?)  \n \n* Illustrator  \n \n* ‚Ä¶  \n \n\nFirst off, if I were to go for one of the standard models, which one? 6-core 512GB or 8-core 1TB? I\'m leaning towards the latter, but do you think it\'s worth it? Cores is mainly important for rendering in architectural work, right?, as most other work is single threaded?\n\nAs for upgrades in general, which upgrades would be most worth it do you think? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 6 ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> 8-core CPU?  \n \n* 512GB ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> 1TB SSD?  \n \n* 16GB ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> 32GB RAM?  \n \n* Any GPU upgrade necessary?  \n \n\n[Link to Apple\'s spec configuration site](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch)\n\nMy budget is pretty flexible, I\'m not like super rich lol, but I\'ve saved up quite a lot for this investment.\n\nI\'m also looking for a good USB-C monitor, and possibly a new mouse too, if you got some further advice/recommendations\n\nIf any of you made it this far, first off thank you for your time!

My 4 year old iPad mini 4 is starting to die (home button is dead) so I might be moving more to working from my phone.\n\nAre these things worth the 512 GB? Or does this sound like overkill for my uses? \n\nMost Importantly!! \n\n1. Does the iPhone start to slow down when lots of pictures are loaded on? This has occurred on my S7 Edge. \n2.

I have been through all of these the past 3 months.\n\nThe fact that some units are dead silent and some others produce this popping sound may indicate that different chips from different manufacturers are used on the audio interface. This is just a speculation by me but it's the only one that could explain this inconsistency between the units (especially in case that is a software bug).\n\nEither way or another this is frustrating and it is on Apple to fix this. And sadly it is us who may need to push the company to this direction. For any user that is having the issue, i am urging you to insist by calling them, sending them emails and don't stop pushing until this is getting addressed.\n\nIf the popping occurs in a software that is critical for you, just ask me to make a third video to demonstrate this and if you have some findings please post them here or in the thread i opened (link above) to let the other users know.\n\nCheers!"", ""I don't have this issue with speaker popping when skipping through videos.

I had to use my iPhone to reflect the sound back but it works', ""I think we've been trolled, boys"", 'That\'s a ""pro"" feature u just discovered.', 'This is so funny', 'Lol it worked for me haha', 'Demo iPhone in store said to look it in the web...', ""OI SIRI, I USED „Äé ZA REFERENCE „Äè TO CAUSE AN INFINITE LOOP LIKE THAT MAFIA BOSS, GIORNO DID TO DIAVOLO, AIN'T IT WACKY!?""]","""Hey Siri, I just"" causes an infinite loop! Just found this today on my Apple Watch. Maybe everyone already knows about it.

If you say, ""Hey Siri, I just"", Siri responds with, ""I don't know what you mean by, 'Hey Siri, I just'"". Siri then hears itself saying ""Hey Siri, I just"" and responds again with the same message, forever, until you press the button to stop it.

Kind of neat.

Edit: mine is an Apple Watch 3, watchOS 6.1

Edit 2: *Hey Siri, I just caused an infinite loop* also works!

Doing this would mirror the iOS standard behavior with tab bars and navigation controllers where if you‚Äôre n pages deep and a tab‚Äôs controller and you double tap the tab bar button it automatically pops to the first view controller on the navigation stack.

I second the suggestion on making a one time/life-time purchase price, I tend to forget about monthly/yearly payments and get frustrated when I do.

Thinking one of them was the old unoptimized version, I deleted it and found both of the files immediately removed from Document Cloud. Despite the fact that they had different names within Document Cloud, they were treated as the same file and promptly deleted.\n\nYou can imagine my anger when I found out there was no restore functionality in Document Cloud, nor is there local storage of any cloud files in macOS. I lost notes and highlights on a 1,000 page PDF without any ability to restore and months of work was lost.\n\nNeedless to say, I want to get the f\\*&$ away from Adobe, not just for its lack of restore functionality (which iCloud and Office 365 both offer), but also because the performance of Acrobat DC Pro on macOS is abysmal because its lack of 2D GPU Acceleration (something its Windows equivalent has had for over 10 years).\n\nI've recently purchased PDF Expert for macOS and am using the free version on iPadOS, which seems to function well for my purposes and performance is much better. Am I losing anything by switching to iCloud for storage and PDF Expert for annotating? I know the desktop PDF Expert lacks OCR and the iPadOS version is a paid upgrade for OCR, but the scholarly books/journals I download already have OCR applied anyway. As far as I can tell, iCloud would let me restore files if need be, plus I have Time Machine as a local backup as well.\n\nTLDR; Thinking of switching from Adobe Acrobat/Document Cloud to iCloud/PDF Expert for annotating book/journal PDFs. Aside from OCR is there anything I am missing here? This seems like a win-win on all sides for me.""]","Daily Tech Support Thread - [November 16]

Just wrong about the reason. The biggest issue wasn‚Äôt the keyboard (though much was made of not having a physical keyboard). The bigger issue for businesses was that it had no support for Exchange ActiveSync. The native client was IMAP or POP3 only. I supported Exchange back then and we didn‚Äôt have those protocols enabled, let alone exposed to the internet. We weren‚Äôt going to turn them on just for the iPhone, so we turned away any requests we got to hook them up to Exchange. Also, the BYOD model didn‚Äôt really exist. Most businesses still had large corporate accounts and purchased their own devices. Very few were willing to shell out the higher asking price for an iPhone. I can say in my organization at the time it was seen almost as an expensive toy, not a business device like the Treo or Blackberry were.\n\nTo be sure, there weren‚Äôt many other good choices either. BES was easily the best enterprise solution at that time. Otherwise you had to run a sync client on your computer or have a third party solution like Good. I remember having to run two small Windows servers - one to support devices on Sprint using their custom app and another to support Verizon devices. Once the iPhone had ActiveSync it was game over for the Treo. BlackBerry did themselves in by letting the OS get really outdated while iOS (and later, Android) were making huge advances. App developers defected from Blackberry once the consumer market for them dried up and the rest is pretty much history. Windows Phone never really got off the ground, let alone become a serious competitor to anyone. There was pretty much zero support from developers and the software was buggy as hell. It was all very typical Microsoft back then. They still had an arrogance about them, thinking they would just roll over everyone because they had the resources, but it was all poorly executed. They also did things that pissed off the few customers they did have, like abandoning updates for devices in less than a year. It was obvious early on that there wasn‚Äôt room for five platforms to compete against each other, so it was just a matter of time before the market shook out.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôll do music, it‚Äôll do Internet‚Äô\n\nYeah, as did most any phone in that time.

My iPhone 6s 16GB running iOS 13 is stuck in a boot loop. This one is different from the usual ones because this did not happen during a software update or anything to do with software corruption. I had a notification badge on the Messages app with seemingly no new message. When I backed out of the app I noticed that the phone was laggy. Now I know that this may raise red flags about this having something to do with the Messages app (bug or corruption) but I ***think*** it doesn\'t. I should also mention that the iPhone was **quite** beat up (no physical damage) as it was quite old, so this random lag was not particularly unusual. Anyway, as an impulsive reaction, I decided to restart the phone thinking that should fix the notification badge and lag issue. I had done this **hundreds** of times before. And that\'s it! That\'s how the phone bricked. Now, to clarify what I meant with ""beat up""....\n\nThe phone storage was almost full (couple hundred megs were free from what I remember). And the battery was bad. Really Bad. I did not care though because this was a secondary phone. the battery could barely last an hour of actual use. I tried all of the typical troubleshooting tips for this kind of issue. I tried going into recovery mode and updating my iPhone on iTunes (where it gives the option to update or restore). iTunes said that the phone could not be updated but only restored :( I know restoring may fix the issue but I really don\'t want to lose my data (and I did not back up my data for a **long** time before this, I know, really irresponsible of me :( ). Also, I only have the basic 5 GB of iCloud storage space which used to back up my data but that got over pretty quickly, so again, I will lose all of my recent data.\n\nNaturally, knowing how bad the battery is, I assumed that one possible cause for the boot loop was that the battery is unable to output enough power for the phone to start up. I tried turning it on with a charger (Original Apple Cable and Wall Adapter) and also after draining and the fully charging it overnight. But all of that did nothing. I decided that I\'m running out of options and I should bring it in at an Apple Authorized Service Center. They said that in order to check any issues with hardware, they must first rule out software issues. This meant that they would need to restore my device causing me to lose all of my data. When I tried to explain this to him, he said that this was the protocol and that he could not troubleshoot the hardware before restoring. So that didn\'t work. I then took it to a 3rd party repair shop, where the guy tried switching my iPhone on with another iPhone 6s battery and to my surprise, it still did not start! So I guess battery is ruled out. He also mentioned that the cause could very well be that the storage was full. He assumed that on his own, which makes me think that that\'s the actual cause. I should also mention that my storage was full for a very long time before this, and was also worse at times with it showing that the phone had only a couple of MBs left. When the issue began, as far as I can tell the storage was at least a 100 MBs free. So what could the issue be?\n\nAt this point I am running out of options and it seems like I may need to restore my device and lose my data :( oh and I should also describe the boot loop. What happens is that after holding down the power button, the Apple logo shows up and stays up for **1-2 mins** before the screen goes black and the process starts again. Can anyone figure this out?', '13) Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself\n\n14)yes']","Daily Tech Support Thread - [November 15]

&#x200B;

It's been a while since I've posted here about my open-source project, Slide for Reddit, but I have released a pretty major update and am excited to show it off.

&#x200B;

If you haven't tried Slide in a while, here's a taste of what you're missing out on!

* v5 takes full advantage of iOS 13's new features, including automatic night mode, [haptic link previews](https://i.imgur.com/o2XtsPB.png), and a more intuitive view stacking navigation. Oh, and SFSymbols are in use everywhere for a more native Apple feel compared to previous versions
* v5 also brings a new way to save and organize your content: Save Collections! Long press on the post save icon and store posts in an unlimited number of custom folders, which sync automatically between all of your devices
* v4 brought fully customized themes! Express your creativity, create new themes, and share them with other Slide users
* v4 overhauled menus throughout Slide to [match iOS 13's new standard menu design](https://i.imgur.com/6HBODwy.png), complete with link previews
* If you are interested in a full changelog for these last two updates, you can find them on our community subreddit, r/slide_ios! Both updates boast over thirty new features and many other improvements and bug fixes

&#x200B;

Some other features that make Slide unique include

* Beautiful **iPad display options**, including [Multi-Column](https://i.imgur.com/WisO9uX.jpg) mode and [Split Content](https://i.imgur.com/tW9cFtb.png) mode
* Comes with a companion Apple Watch app
* Thousands of theme options and hundreds of other settings allow you to **make Slide truly yours**
* Full support for native rendering of Reddit Markdown, [including scrollable inline tables](https://i.imgur.com/4hwJ1B4.png), quote boxes, and code blocks
* **Full moderation suite** with a separate Moderation dashboard makes moderation a breeze
* Slide is **fully offline capable**, with configurable sync settings that let you bring your content anywhere, internet or not
* Read Later allows you to save posts to a separate pane of the app so you can re-visit posts for reading later
* Subreddit content filters let you hide content types you don't want to see from individual subreddits, and a full filtering suite lets you hide posts matching flair, titles, self-text, and more!
* Much more for you to discover and enjoy

&#x200B;

Slide is fully open-source, [which means its entire codebase, including all Pro features, is available for free online](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios), and developers can create Pull Requests for additions to Slide! It also allows privacy-conscious users to see exactly what code is running on their devices. Hint: there is no tracking, no ads, no analytics, and all Reddit features are available for free to everyone :)

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading and I hope you give Slide a try! Want to connect with me? Feel free to send me a PM or email, and [join us on Slide's Discord server](https://discord.gg/kQNRH2S) where we discuss features and development.

Hey r/apple!

&#x200B;

It's been a while since I've posted here about my open-source project, Slide for Reddit, but I have released a pretty major update and am excited to show it off.

&#x200B;

If you haven't tried Slide in a while, here's a taste of what you're missing out on!

* v5 takes full advantage of iOS 13's new features, including automatic night mode, [haptic link previews](https://i.imgur.com/o2XtsPB.png), and a more intuitive view stacking navigation. Oh, and SFSymbols are in use everywhere for a more native Apple feel compared to previous versions
* v5 also brings a new way to save and organize your content: Save Collections! Long press on the post save icon and store posts in an unlimited number of custom folders, which sync automatically between all of your devices
* v4 brought fully customized themes! Express your creativity, create new themes, and share them with other Slide users
* v4 overhauled menus throughout Slide to [match iOS 13's new standard menu design](https://i.imgur.com/6HBODwy.png), complete with link previews
* If you are interested in a full changelog for these last two updates, you can find them on our community subreddit, r/slide_ios! Both updates boast over thirty new features and many other improvements and bug fixes

&#x200B;

Some other features that make Slide unique include

* Beautiful **iPad display options**, including [Multi-Column](https://i.imgur.com/WisO9uX.jpg) mode and [Split Content](https://i.imgur.com/tW9cFtb.png) mode
* Comes with a companion Apple Watch app
* Thousands of theme options and hundreds of other settings allow you to **make Slide truly yours**
* Full support for native rendering of Reddit Markdown, [including scrollable inline tables](https://i.imgur.com/4hwJ1B4.png), quote boxes, and code blocks
* **Full moderation suite** with a separate Moderation dashboard makes moderation a breeze
* Slide is **fully offline capable**, with configurable sync settings that let you bring your content anywhere, internet or not
* Read Later allows you to save posts to a separate pane of the app so you can re-visit posts for reading later
* Subreddit content filters let you hide content types you don't want to see from individual subreddits, and a full filtering suite lets you hide posts matching flair, titles, self-text, and more!
* Much more for you to discover and enjoy

&#x200B;

Slide is fully open-source, [which means its entire codebase, including all Pro features, is available for free online](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios), and developers can create Pull Requests for additions to Slide! It also allows privacy-conscious users to see exactly what code is running on their devices. Hint: there is no tracking, no ads, no analytics, and all Reddit features are available for free to everyone :)

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading and I hope you give Slide a try! Want to connect with me? Feel free to send me a PM or email, and [join us on Slide's Discord server](https://discord.gg/kQNRH2S) where we discuss features and development.

Even though the Apple Computers are from 2013, they work so much better than the chromebooks that take forever to start up, load a webpage, and they are just a pain to use.

They were useful tools, but they weren‚Äôt necessarily fun to use, and when things aren‚Äôt fun to use, you‚Äôre less inclined to continue to use them.\n\nAlmost every benefit of Chromebooks in schools boils down to low costs, ease of deployment, ease of management, and ease of use.  But if you put an iPad and a Chromebook in front of school age children and asked them which one they want to use, I‚Äôd be willing to bet they‚Äôd be more willing to pick the iPad.

Dear Apple,

We love your design and appreciate the care, attention, and time that goes into designing your packaging. It is an orchestra of sensory experience and is forever tied to the Apple brand. 

BUT, at the end of the day, we  pay extra for that beautiful packaging that most of us ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù after taking out our shiny new device.  

A proposal: give Us an option of: fancy packaging -OR- green/minimal packaging (or even the option to give the packaging right back to you to reuse for someone else). What do you say? #GreenApple

So before I went I kind of had this feeling to delete things from my phone. I deleted any app that had any type of financial information or linked to my back account in anyway and also all of my social media apps because I didn‚Äôt want them going through them. I also did a backup before I went and then I was going to delete all the pictures from my phone too but forgot because they were texting me that they moved my appointment time up so I was trying to rush over there.

He asked me for my passcode TWICE in that time frame which I, at the time, still didn‚Äôt think anything of.

I walk in my house turn on my phone about to text someone and realize there‚Äôs a message to an unsaved number!!!!! I open it and instantly wanted to cry!!! This guy went through my gallery and sent himself one of my EXTREMELY PERSONAL pictures that I took for my boyfriend and it had my geolocation on so he also knows where I live!!! AND THIS PICTURE WAS FROM ALMOST A YEAR AGO SO HE HAD TO HAVE SCROLLED UP FOR A WHILE TO GET TO THAT PICTURE being that I have over 5,000 pics in my phone!!!!

I have no idea if he sent more than the picture that he forgot to delete and I have NO CLUE WTH HES GOING TO DO WITH THEM!!!

I have a windows laptop that‚Äôs super powerful, but it‚Äôs also 17‚Äù, bulky, and just takes up too much work space.\n\nSo, I‚Äôve decided to go ahead and get a MacBook because I literally have every other Apple product, I need a dedicated laptop for work, and it‚Äôs be easier to carry around. Where I‚Äôm lost is which model I should get to do campaign work and to do work in law school. I want one that‚Äôll last me a while too, so that‚Äôs another predicament.\n\nThe model I was hoping to get was the 13‚Äù, 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, since it‚Äôs $1,699 at Best Buy right now. However, I started to have some worries because it is DDR3, and I know through Apple I can upgrade to 16GB, I‚Äôm still a little concerned about how future proof it‚Äôll be. Upgrading to 16GB RAM while downgrading the SSD to 256GB puts at $2,000 through Apple, and they‚Äôre the only place I can get it customized like that. I probably won‚Äôt be using it for anything graphically intensive since I do have my Windows laptop, but the integrated graphics do worry me a bit.\n\nThe other option is the 15‚Äù, with a 6-core 2.6 GHz processor, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and it‚Äôs dedicated graphics. It‚Äôs $2,399, which is a little out of my price range, but I feel more confident that it‚Äôll last me longer. The other issue is it‚Äôs size. I‚Äôm wanting something more portable, and I feel like a 15‚Äù MacBook would be more portable than what I currently have, if I could get 13‚Äù that‚Äôd be better.\n\nI‚Äôm really inexperienced with OS X and what it‚Äôs demands are, so that‚Äôs another reason I‚Äôm asking. Would the 13‚Äù model I suggested be good to do school and campaign work for at least 5 years without and upgrade, or should I go for the more expensive 15‚Äù? Also, when it comes to MacBooks, I know they tend to be lighter, but would 15‚Äù be too bulky to carry around and take up a lot of table space? I‚Äôve been trying to visualize it, but I‚Äôm having difficulties.', 'On my external keyboard, how do I map cmd+{ and cmd+} to swtich between tabs on Chrome and [Terminal.app](https://Terminal.app) instead of Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+shift+tab??', 'So I want to get an external hard drive of some kind for my iPad, but I‚Äôd really like to use some kind of encryption, if at all possible.

You should only very ocassionally power cycle a battery, for calibration. In general you should try to keep it somewhere in the 50-80% region.

Now go back to Up Next, and you'll find your list advanced to the same position the last song you selected was, necessitating that you scroll all the way back to the top to see the next song.  \n\nScreenshot cropping: When taking a screenshot and editing it immediately, changes made to the photo don't save. At first I thought I was being dumb and not saving them, but I've been doing this for over two years now.

I thought the role of the SIM card was to just identify your device on its network. When I went to the Verizon booth the guy there agreed with me too but humored the idea and swapped it anyway.\n\nAm I wrong? I‚Äôm on Verizon if that makes a difference.

A look at the most downloaded apps on the App Store, and you\'ll see so many Google apps.\n\nI love how many amazing apps there are on the app store, but if I use anything other than the official apple app, then I lose so many neat features. (ie. opening map links in emails will take me to the app store to download apple maps, instead of opening the link up in google maps).\n\nI love how all my devices sync with each other. But I\'m having difficulty with the ecosystem. **Is it really worth switching into if the benefits are only seen when using the Apple variant of the apps?** Or are there alternatives? Any tips/tricks/tutorials on how to maximize the benefits of the Apple Ecosystem?\n\n**TLDR;** Not sure why people say Apple Ecosystem is great when it doesn\'t work unless you only use apple version of apps (apple maps, apple music, etc).

However, some network-stability issues with that setup prompted me to try relocating the website to a more modern, more powerful machine... like my [Macintosh Color Classic II](https://i.imgur.com/CaC6HDO.jpg) (built in 1993). With a Motorola 68030 CPU running at a super-speedy 33 megahertz (compared to the 16MHz \'030 in the Mac SE/30), I\'m hoping that the CCII can keep up with the load a little more reliably. I\'m also experimenting with some different web-hosting software: previously I was using [MacHTTP](http://www.machttp.org/), but I found that after a few hours it would start to bog down, so now I\'m trying ""[Quid Pro Quo Plus 2.1](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/quid-pro-quo-213)"" - hopefully it holds up a little more reliably under the incoming wave of visitors.\n\nSo, here I am, inviting a big friendly hug-of-death from all of you at r/Apple! Check out the page, sign the guest-book, and hopefully have a good time :-)\n\n**UPDATE:** I posted this before bed last night, and found that the site got to ~2,000 visitors overnight before the Mac froze. I rebooted and tweaked some settings and it‚Äôs humming along again - let‚Äôs see how long it lasts this time!\n\n**UPDATE 2:** I\'ve switched back from Quid Pro Quo to MacHTTP as my hosting tool. QPQ is vastly more ""feature rich,"" but all those additional features add significant additional (and unnecessary, given how simple my site is) load on an already-struggling CPU. MacHTTP is pretty bare-bones, but it seems to be handling visitors at 3-4X the rate of QPQ. [Here\'s a pic of MacHTTP I shot just now](https://i.imgur.com/A58lWAR.jpg) - if you look closely, you can see that its served ~2,000 visitors in ~40 minutes, while QPQ needed 5+ hours to reach that number before completely freezing the Mac. I guess the lesson here is that highly-feature-rich software which hasn\'t been updated in 22+ years *miiiiiiight* not be super stable...\n\n**UPDATE 3:** Coming up on 2 hours since I rebooted and switched back to MacHTTP as my server app, and we\'ve had close to 8,000 visits in that time - amazing! [Here\'s a short video](https://i.imgur.com/sNjxM2t.mp4) of what the machine looks like right now as it works to keep up with the Reddit Hug of Death (spoiler: it\'s not super exciting LOL). If you look just to the left of the Mac, you may notice some odd flickering (Imgur\'s compression isn\'t helping) - that\'s the green LED on the Ethernet card blinking wildly being reflected by the wall as it tries to keep up with all of you\n\n**UPDATE 4:** We‚Äôve crossed 14,000 unique visitors so far today without a reboot - that‚Äôs gotta be a new personal record! https://i.imgur.com/wVH9l55.jpg\n\n**UPDATE 5:** Well, we got to 30,000+ visitors in the past day-and-a-half before the guestbook was attacked by a stupid script posting pro-Hitler comments. I guess having an anonymous guestbook open to the world in 2019 was just inviting trouble. Oh well - I\'m disabling anonymous comments and purging all this garbage.

I purchased a brand new 2019 Macbook Pro, i5, 16 gig RAM, 500G hard drive in mid June. (Over $3000CAD after taxes)\n\nProblems occured in mid August and i was able to bring it into an apple store after not being able to fix the problem at home. At first it was thought to be a software issue and left the laptop at the apple store for them to completely wipe the software and re install the OS. (August 27th- 28th) It then became a hardware issue where the entire logic board was replaced along with the touch bar. What I was told would be a 4-5 day repair, took 15 days.(September 4th - September 18th) At this point, an online apple employee (because my laptop was purchased online) said for such an inconvenience, they will offer me an item from the apple store. ie, airpods/external harddrive.\n\nAfter a few more days of working with the laptop, more issues presented themselves. I spoke with the same online representative that has known about this since august and waited while they talked to the engineering division to see what the problem was. (September 30th - October 6th) and I had to take the product back again for what was an I/O board issue. Another repair that was quoted to be 4-5 days took 12 to complete. (October 16th - October 27th)\n\nAt this point I would consider this a refurbished laptop. Basically everything in this has been replaced and i personally dont think a product from the apple store helps in case another problem shows up in this unit. I sent another email to the online help to say that, and got a call 1 week later saying that that is all they can offer. I asked about an exchange in laptops for the same specs because i don't trust this unit anymore after it only being 4-5months old, and they responded with policies that they cannot do that and all they can offer is a product worth up to $300 for the inconvenience.\n\nAm i being crazy by simply wanting an exchange of laptops? If i wanted a refurbished laptop to save some money i would have done it in June, but now im left with what is practically a refurbished unit. I shouldnt have had to pay full price.\n\nTL;DR took apple 2 months over 3 repairs to fix my brand new 2019 laptop.

First I spoke on the phone with tech support and did software troubleshooting, but the issue persisted. I took it to a certified Apple retailer, they fixed the shutting off problem. It still ran hot. It's been sent to the Apple Repair Center two times (it took about three weeks total to get the parts fixed) and had the fans replaced and other parts and it's still running hot, it's consistently above 100 degrees up to 114 degrees when charging. I have an infrared thermometer to gauge the heat and have been tracking the battery life, it's only about 5 hours (online it says it should be about 10). I can't return it (I want the same Macbook Pro, I'm an Apple loyalist) because I'm past the 2 week return period. I love my new Macbook but it's just too hot and I need longer battery life.

Except for the sister, we‚Äôre all grown adults, so  not really sure why a connection like this is needed. However, there‚Äôs a language barrier and cultural aspects to consider, and my refusal to join could be interpreted as an insult. For example, my FIL also offered to buy me out of my cell phone plan and get me a new cell phone on his family plan, but I politely declined. My FIL has proven to be financially unreliable, and occasionally doesn‚Äôt pay the family‚Äôs phone bill. I would rather pay for the assurance of my own coverage, but I simply told him that I was locked into a plan that I couldn‚Äôt get out of right now. Even with that explanation his pride injured because he felt as if I was insinuating that he didn‚Äôt have the ability to buy me out of my contract. My spouse had to do some smoothing over to rectify the situation. But now I seem to have found myself in a similar one. \nI am under the impression that only my FIL‚Äôs card can be added to the account for purchases.   That would be an issue if I ever decided to rent movies or something similar because I would be asking him for permission. As a 25-year-old it would feel like a step backward in my development as an adult. My apprehension in joining family sharing is motivated by not only financial reasons but privacy as well. I have sensitive photos and links stored in bookmarks on my phone that I wouldn‚Äôt want my in-laws to have access to. \n\nTLDR: Is there any way I can accept family sharing and just opt out of certain sharing features? Specifically, is it possible to keep my card that‚Äôs listed on file and keep my apps and bookmarks private if I‚Äôm part of this family sharing thing?', 'So I‚Äôm having this issue where I can never send sms‚Äô.

One of the things I like about it is the cross-device syncing (including between phone and web app). I thought I'd give the Apple Podcasts app a try now that I've converted over to iPhone from Android.\n\nIs there no way to play podcasts on the web? I like to listen to podcasts at work, but can't install iTunes on my computer, so I was hoping there was a web interface. \n\nI see that you can now listen to podcasts through [podcasts.apple.com](https://podcasts.apple.com), but you can't sign in to sync your progress, and you have to find a link to the podcast, because you can't just search for it on the website.

This is something that has been bugging me for some time and I think a lot of people can relate. The tech world has become far too obsessed with curation and that has really harmed the end user experience. Curation (for TV shows, movies, music, etc...) is an important feature to suggest new content to check out, but it should be a feature, NOT the foundation of the user interface. That just makes for a bad UX because it makes the entire interface feel like one giant advertisement.

We see this problem across the tech world - from YouTube to Netflix to Apple Music and now the Apple TV app - and I think we need to see a shift in focus. Curation should be a feature, not the entire paradigm around which an app is built.

Here's what I mean: **[Curation Should Be A Feature, Not A User Interface](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/curation-should-be-a-feature-not-a-user-interface-ae52384bc30c)**

This has been terrible for several years now with regards to Apple Music, and now the same issue is popping up with the emergence of Apple TV.

-------------------------------------------

**Here's how Apple TV should work:**

**Apple:** *Hey, we've got this great new TV app that functions as a repository for all your content. You pick and choose what 'Channels' you want, you order them within the TV app, and the TV app functions as a central repository for all your content, all organized in one unified UI that's accessible via any of your Apple devices and controllable via Siri. You sign up for Channels, those media companies get paid, and we get a cut of that for providing the unified service, just like with our App Store model. Oh, and we'll throw in our own TV+ channel for free, as a perk to entice you into this TV ecosystem!*

**Users:** *Awesome! Here are the 15 shows I want to watch! I'll order all the services I need in order to get those 15 shows, and then you'll provide a UI where I can track and watch those 15 shows!*

**Apple:** *Will do!*

-------------------------------------------

But that's not how it works. The ""Watch Now"" tab is a complete mess, with everything from every streaming service (including TV+) being thrown at you like a series of ads. I think what **SHOULD** happen is the ""Up Next"" functionality should be dramatically expanded and given its own tab, so that it functions like I highlighted above - you add the shows you're watching and it functions like one of those TV show tracker apps, to keep track of everything you've watched, allowing you to rate each episode, telling you when the next episode airs, and of course, allowing you to watch it.

The ""Watch Now"" tab will continue to exist, but maybe it can be renamed ""Browse"" or ""Recommendations"" so that it continues to curate and recommend content for you. But once you see things that interest you, you'd add them to the new tab, which can be called ""Collection"", or maybe even the ""Library"" tab could be converted into this.

**tl;dr - The Apple TV app should add a new tab in which you can add all the shows across all streaming services/'Channels' you want, and you'd have a UI that functions like one of those TV tracker apps, listing all the shows you're currently following, your progress, your ratings for each episode, the next air dates, and of course, allowing you to watch the next episode.**",apple,This is quite possibly the single biggest software UI design problem affecting the tech world today. It's everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to Apple Music to the new Apple TV app.,1154,"['[deleted]', 'The problem is that curation usually seems to deliver vastly better results for these companies. I feel like Twitter is the best example for this, because the default Twitter app keeps defaulting you to this ‚ÄúHome‚Äù view where it shows you the tweets that it thinks you want to see most, instead of the latest tweets. You can now switch to default timeline view, yet it even tells you that it will switch you back after a while. They‚Äôre not doing that because they want to annoy you, they‚Äôre doing it because based on their data they get more clicks/viewers/whatever that way. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs annoying for sure, but it‚Äôs all based on raw data to make the most money possible.', 'Agree with you, Good points. This was a fun read. \n\nJust my opinion is that when I open the Netflix or Prime app, I have already decided what I want to watch however in some cases the recommendations has lead me to watch good new shows. If you speak to Netflix, they will say discoverability is a big issue for new shows.', 'YouTube‚Äôs main page with its ‚Äútrending‚Äù and suggested videos feels like one of the worst for this, but the subscriptions tab and playlists do still allow you to have your own personal area where it‚Äôs only the content you chose. This is something lacking on many platforms.', 'The TV app is awful. It only shows some of the shows I watch. It doesn‚Äôt show me what is free and what I need to subscribe to watch. 90% of what it shows on there is irrelevant to me.

And AppleTV isn't the only offender, seems like everyone is trying to push you to watch all of the new shows they keep producing (e.g. Netflix, amazon)."", 'Yes! I‚Äôm not a fan of the overall layout of Apple Music because most of the tabs on the bottom go completely unused by me. Radio and Browse are two tabs I never touch and 99% of the time all of my UX is limited to the Library tab. I miss the old iPod inspired layout where I could have tabs for Artists, Albums, etc. Browse and For You should be combined. Same with Netflix, which I usually watch from the Xbox app. The tabs for My List and Continue Watching are rarely in the same spot I last saw them and I have to scroll through a dozen fluctuating categories to find them. I appreciate the idea of curated lists but I‚Äôd rather have more control over my libraries.', 'Nope. The biggest UI bullshit is pressing a button when the screen changes 1/10 of a second before hand and you hit the wrong thing.', 'The more you are into a subject the less useful curation is to you. I have spent decades building my music collection. Inevitably I am unimpressed with whatever is suggested by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù for me. I find that algorithmic radio stations do a better job on all of the services for me. Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I always feel like I have better taste than whoever is giving me suggestions.', 'I fucking hate Netflix and Apple Music for this.\n\nApple Music will consistently dominate my For You page with new releases they‚Äôve been paid to push. I have every Chemical Brothers release and when their new album dropped this year was it on there? Was it fuck. Was Taylor Swift for whom I‚Äôve never played a song? Yes all over it\n\nAnd Netflix give me strength....my wife watches one Hallmark movie and then that‚Äôs it ‚Äî‚Äî the whole of Netflix geared around these shows to the point my wife thinks Netflix makes them all and it‚Äôs all that‚Äôs on there.', 'I‚Äôve stopped buying apps ever since Apple redesigned the App Store. Just can‚Äôt find shit that I actually want anymore.', 'This is exactly why I switched to using Marvis instead of the music app. \n\nI‚Äôm able to create my own categories and decide what content is placed in it. It‚Äôs nice having a place to go get curation and suggestions, but it can‚Äôt be the whole interface.', 'Absolutely. I recently went down my notes list on movies I want to watch and searched for them on Netflix and Amazon. This list of movies I\'ve been waiting to see, sometimes for years, was almost completely available to me on services I already have and use frequently, but because all I ever see is crap their algorithms think I might like (or, more likely, stuff they wish I liked), I never knew that things I actually wanted to see had shown up on these services.\n\nNetflix curation used to be good. These days, it\'s abysmal. It only shows me whatever Netflix just released, most of which is high-budget dreck. Prime is even worse. There are giant blocks taking up my screen with whatever bullshit they have just released and I don\'t even know where my list actually is. There\'s a ""Watch Next"" section, but I have yet to figure out how things get on there, or how they\'re ordered.\n\nAt some point, these companies need to come to terms with the fact that their customers are people, not variables in their model. They came to these services with their own tastes and interests, and mostly already know what they want to watch or listen to or buy.', 'I disagree on Apple Music. I only ever use the library tab which is non-curated. The other tabs are almost useless to me so I ignore them.', 'Agreed. I don\'t mind it in specific spots. Like when I scroll down in Netflix and see a ""Because you watched XXXX"" group of shows/movies. That\'s not bad. But it shouldn\'t be everywhere.\n\nApple Music has some nice curated playlists, too. But I don\'t want them shoved in my face.', ""Prime video doesn't even have a recently watched section lmao"", 'I like the approach. The issue is the fact that the TV app doesn‚Äòt even allow you to... tweak recommendations? I should have a like and dislike option like Apple Music, preferably a ‚Äûdon‚Äòt show this again‚Äú flag I can plaster over shows or movies I hate.\n\nAs it stands they solely rely on purchase and watch history, which just doesn‚Äòt work nowadays when you want to find new content to enjoy by trial and error.', 'Curation reflects better in kpi. Your alternative solution may be good for user but the numbers won‚Äôt back it up and your manager will think you‚Äôre incompetent for delivering lower numbers.', 'I wish curation wasn‚Äôt so aggressive.\n\nFor example if I watch one restoration YouTube video, I get flooded with other restoration videos. Mind you, I love restoration videos. But I also love Batman, LEGO, football, cricket, iPad and Star Wars...\n\nBut no matter what I watch, it seems YouTube insists I need to watch another hundred of the same. \n\nSo, if the companies/devs etc could turn down the recommendations or offer a way to do so, that‚Äôd be great.', 'Unpopular opinion:  **I almost always prefer the curation/suggestion-based UIs, and switching back ""dumber"" UIs usually leads to an inferior experience for me.** I haven\'t tried Apple TV+ yet, but here are a few examples:\n\nYouTube:  I _vastly_ prefer YouTube\'s home page to my subscriptions tab.  Their home page consistently and somewhat uncannily figures out what videos I want to watch next, and which of my subscriptions I\'m actually engaging with.  For example, I like watching the Colbert Late show monologues but not the interviews.  YouTube\'s home page has figured this out and recommends me the new monologues every day right when they come out, whereas in my subscription page I need to dig through to find them among the tons of other content that show puts out, plus my other subscriptions whose content I don\'t really enjoy much anymore.\n\nTwitter:  I also vastly prefer their algorithmic view to the old ""following only"" view.  The algorithmic view gives me a good mix of content from my follows, plus who they are following, who they are retweeting, and generally popular and interesting Tweets.  When I switch back to the only seeing my followers, or viewing in complete chronological order, Twitter suddenly becomes much less interesting, and I\'m much less likely to find interesting people to follow or Tweets I\'ll like.\n\nFor video playback services, I think the problem isn\'t that these services are doing curation/suggestion based UIs, it\'s that they\'re doing them poorly.  For example, if I watch half a season of a show in one day on Netflix, the next day when I boot up the app, the next episode should be front and center.  If it\'s not, Netflix hasn\'t done a good job figuring out what I wanted to watch.  In my experience, though, they do the right thing, and ""continue watching"" shows up first.  If this isn\'t happening in Apple TV+, that\'s the issue.  The issue isn\'t that its making its content recommendations front and center.  I don\'t mind that from Netflix, and generally enjoy picking content from their homepage (I usually pick shows they recommend more often than I even pick from my own saved list of shows).\n\nThis is the direction we\'re headed, sorry if you don\'t like it.  According to all available data, recommending users content using algorithms leads to higher engagement, so we\'re stuck with it.  Personally, I find it leads to better experiences.', 'I think why it is so painful to use the suggestions UI is because its only goal is to keep you in the app you\'re in and if you get entertained, so be it. Netflix, Apple TV+, Hulu, YouTube, etc are all fighting for your time (i.e. ""engagement with the app"") so they are giving you options on their service to keep you from going to the competitor\'s app / site. It helps fuel metrics that shareholders like to see, which is how CEOs keep their jobs.\n\nI agree it is terrible UI.\n\nI think a more friendly, useful method of maintaining engagement would be to bring back 0-5 star ratings and other methods that allow the end-user to curate or ""collect"" their own content. I used to rate every movie I saw on Flixster and continued to use that lousy app until the day it died because of it.', 'How do you upvote a post twice? I really hope Apple sees this.', 'Now The Up Next top shelf is completely gone on Apple TV and replaced with Ads. Wtf Apple?', 'The only app that does curation well, is Spotify.\nApple TV is the worst example. It‚Äôs confusing, there‚Äôs no clear define between ‚Äútheir stuff‚Äù and ‚Äúyour stuff‚Äù. Half the content it ‚Äúcurates‚Äù for me are from other countries‚Äô channels that I can‚Äôt watch.', 'Lol Apple are ALWAYS gonna prioritise their own stuff over others. The idea of a unified screen showing content from Netflix, Stan, Plex, Prime etc is great, sure. But Apple have proven time and time again they\'re not gonna play nice, and instead put all of their services content at the top/front/centre.\n\nThe amount of times I\'ve accidentally gone to their ""unified"" screen and selected something that\'s actually IN my Plex library, only to be taken to the iTunes Store ""buy/rent this film"" screen is...enough to make me avoid that section of the UI entirely.', 'When you put graphic designers that can design ads and posters on your UI/UX this is what happens. Lots of form, little function.\n\nAnd the suggestions are terrible, their algorithms don‚Äôt work. Pretty sure human curation won‚Äôt be any better. \n\nOh and the autoplaying:( Insanity.', ""I disagree. The only reason I use Spotify or Netflix is because they suggest me content I otherwise wouldn't even know about. I don't have time to keep myself updated with pop culture and keep tracking what shows or songs got released last week. Just show up on my homescreen and I'll decide what I want to watch. Give me a category wise tab I'll look if I want to."", 'Netflix is the worst. Finding things there is horrible.', ""I wouldn't even say the problem is curation, I'd say the problem is hostile curation: these services are not showing you what some Smart Algorithm computed you most want to see; they're showing you what the Smart Algorithm predicted would net them the most ad revenue.\n\nI suspect people would be largely content with automated curation if it were the former."", 'A bit hyperbole... possibly the biggest? I can name a few issues that are bigger.', 'Am I the only one that thinks this post is hilariously overblowing this? It **is** a feature. Just like Search is a feature. Just like ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù is a feature. You get all features on all these services. How is this a problem?\n\nOh, because it doesn‚Äôt dump a huge ‚Äúrepository of all your content‚Äù on the screen. What is ‚Äúyour content‚Äù on Netflix, anyway? The things you‚Äôve already watched? Who wants that? People who torrent a million things and keep them as files on a hard drive. Well, go use Plex for that. You‚Äôll like it.\n\nFor everyone else, browsing a big list of files isn‚Äôt helpful. When it comes to TV or movies, people are constantly running out of things they know they want to watch, and they need a way to discover more.\n\nPeople want content recommendations. I‚Äôve actually heard the customers complaints about this: ‚ÄúI want it to know me better each time I come back.‚Äù All of these companies are metrics-driven designers and they wouldn‚Äôt be doing this if it didn‚Äôt work.\n\nAlso, the use of terminology is just all wrong in this post.\n\n‚ÄúCuration‚Äù is when a human hand picks content to recommend at large.\n\n‚ÄúPersonalization‚Äù is when an algorithm picks content for an individual. \n\n‚ÄúUI‚Äù is the blue print for how and where elements are placed in an interface and how they function. A grid of movie tiles is a UI. Which movies they are - whether  they are curated or personalized - is not a UI. It‚Äôs exactly what you want it to be: a feature.\n\nBiggest UI problem in computers today‚Äôs huh? That‚Äôs beyond ridiculous into stupid. Seriously, stop turning your annoyance with a perceived trend into a world emergency for everyone.', 'Can I add Spotify to the mix here?', 'After getting the free Apple TV trial I was thinking the same thing. Holy shit it‚Äôs so confusing. All of it. I was just trying to see what is actually included with Apple TV subscription but it‚Äôs impossible. It mixes their original content in with every other service they have.', 'Hulu is terrible with this too. I use it for maybe only 1-2 shows, and yet every time I launch the app it shows me literally everything BUT those 1-2 shows.', 'Curation is the new world order', 'I opened the movies tab the other day on my Mac and I was getting spammed for Apple TV + content which is TV, not movies...', 'Spotify does this well for me, balancing curation and content.

I‚Äôd open the app on my FireTV and it‚Äôd instantly start playing random stuff that I wasn‚Äôt remotely interested in. I can live with bad curation as such to some extent as long as I can ignore it. For example, in Apple Music I can just never use that screen and it‚Äôs OK. But Netflix is super hostile and Prime is almost as bad (but I actually have Prime for other reasons and don‚Äôt really use it for video or music anyway).\n\nRight now the only streaming service I still like is Crunchyroll. Of course it‚Äôs very narrow in scope, but it starts me off with my queue and it doesn‚Äôt autoplay anything at all.

Glad i stuck with them, because i love them now.",apple,Anyone else feel like the Airpods are MORE comfortable than the Airpods PRO?,153,"['The Pros hurt my ears. The housings - the bits that fit into the ‚Äúcup‚Äù at the bottom of the outer ear - are longer and wider than the standard AirPods. The result was, although I can wear AirPods all day long and forget they‚Äôre there, the Pros would hurt - I mean, they‚Äôd really make my ears *ache* - after an hour or so. \n\nSo, although they worked beautifully, sounded great, and the ANR was da bomb, I sold them to a coworker a day after I bought them. I‚Äôm so disappointed in my ears! Stupid cartilage...', 'Yeah, it‚Äôs the same with me. I can wear the originals for hours and forget they‚Äôre even there. The Pros make my ears hurt after maybe 30mins-1hr. And the Pros have fallen out of my ears just from me smiling. \n\nI found them to work so well on a flight I took this weekend, though, that I‚Äôm going to keep them and hope some good third party tips come out that will make them fit me better.', 'This is highly subjective, but I think a lot of people will share your sentiment.  \n  \nFor me it was the complete opposite, my absolute maximum time limit for AirPods was 90 mins, but usually it was closer to 30.  \nI got them because of the widely praised call quality, and now use them almost exclusively for work.  \nI often have to make 30+ minute phone calls, sometimes back-to-back, and I find myself regularly switching ears to stop the pain, in rare occasions I have to switch back to the handset itself, a major inconvenience as I regularly require 2 hands for my job.\n  \nThe Pros are much better for me, I wore them from full to flat and felt like I could do it again straight away.  \nThese are, by an extremely wide margin, the most comfortable in-ear earbuds I‚Äôve ever used.  \n  \nSound quality has a very noticeable bump (I would say this is objective, tbh), ANC is certainly an upgrade objectively speaking (those that don‚Äôt like it can easily turn it off) and wireless charging is a must for me (though a gimmick to many others), I use it almost exclusively.', 'I‚Äôm glad someone else said this. For some reason the left one just hurts after 5 minutes. I never had any discomfort from OG Pods. I dunno what to do? I love the pros but they feel uncomfortable.', 'Yeah I‚Äôve tried a lot of IEMs before AirPods but none were comfortable enough. Foam tips were itchy and silicone/rubber tips irritated my inner-ears after a while of use. Also after extended use, my ears would hurt. From that, I‚Äôm not convinced that the Pros would be any different. Same with headphones, they would press against my glasses, and my earlobes/temples would be sore.  \nFortunately the AirPods were snug enough and didn‚Äôt fall out my ears, so they‚Äôre a great alternative for me. I‚Äôm not a big fan of noise isolation too.  \nThat said, I‚Äôm leaving the Hi-Fi listening for when I‚Äôm nice and comfy at home, for full sound immersion!', 'Have you tried different tips?', 'Since I started using the largest tip and not shoving the Pros in my ears, the pain from it has eased up and my ears hardly hurt anymore.', 'I generally dislike earbuds with tips because they hurt my ears, and one reason I loved the AirPods so much is that they didn‚Äôt cause any pain. The Pros are a step backwards in comfort for me personally, but only in one ear, and using a larger tip helped get rid of some of the discomfort. The feature trade offs are worth it for me at the moment.', 'Love the pro outside, love the old ones when I‚Äôm just noodling around the kitchen but want to watch TV on the kitchen iPad but not miss half of it when I‚Äôm making coffee or running water etc. The old ones feel like I‚Äôm not wearing anything. The new ones are noticeable but great when listening to podcasts or books or music while I‚Äôm out with the dogs walking past traffic or landscapers with leaf blowers. So yeah old ones more comfortable but pro are much better outside.', 'For me it‚Äôs the opposite because regular AirPods fall out on my left side. \n\nWe‚Äôre all going to be different in this regard.', 'Yes. I just returned my Pros to the Apple store a couple hours ago. Did not like how they felt in my ears at all. I‚Äôll be returning to my regular old AirPods.', 'I had to return mine. I have a larger anti tragus on my left ear and after 30 minutes the pain was insane. So unfortunate because I loved them.', 'I returned mine this evening. My right ear was fine, but the left was a nightmare. The AirPod kept slipping out with every tip and it was incredibly uncomfortable. \n\nBack to my gen 1 AirPods until they die and QC35ii‚Äôs for any ANC needs.', 'Yep. I‚Äôm contemplating returning them until and waiting to see if custom tips come on the market.', ""Never tried the original airpods, but the Pros (with the default, medium tips) feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.\n\nNothing at all...\n\nNothing at all...\n\nNOTHING AT ALL!"", 'YES! my ears start to hurt and get uncomfortable after wearing them many hours. i feel like every review i‚Äôve seen omit to talk about that. yeah sure if you‚Äôre wearing them here and there they don‚Äôt really hurt (in my case). but i‚Äôm wearing my airpods around 8h a day. i‚Äôm gonna return mines too. plus the NS is not really needed in my case. i listen my music loud enough that i can‚Äôt even notice the NS. and the sound quality is about the same, except maybe slightly better base, but the seal needs to be perfect otherwise there‚Äôs some distortion.', ""The Pro's are heavier and larger I think, definitely less comfortable for me - kinda sucks.  Especially seems to hurt my left ear.  The small tips feel better but they don't always get a good seal."", ""I got Airpods because they don't have a silicone tip. The Pros are a no go for me because of that."", 'I feel a bit of pressure from the seal and the ANC but now I‚Äôve gotten used to it. The ANC is honestly okay and not great tbh', 'I returned mine. I can wear Airpods for hours and forget they are in my ear. 30-45 minutes with Pro and I have ear pain and headache. \n  \nOh well. Sound isolation was great, but fit sucked. At least for me.', 'They don‚Äôt fit in my ear/canal. I can run and lift with the OG ones. Any jaw flexing or slight ear moving pushes the out. Tried all 3 tips. Waiting for a Black Friday deal on the AirPod 2nd gen.', 'The Airpods 2 keeps falling in my ear but the Pros doesn‚Äôt', 'I got massive pain in my ear cartilage and horrible headache after about an hour of use with the Pro, had to return it and went back to my 2nd gen. I didn‚Äôt find the sound quality that much better on the pro either', 'Exact same issue, the Pro was an upgrade from the OG AirPods I had all the way back from launch, couldn‚Äôt last more than 15 minutes with them! Returned them the next day and got the 2nd gen AirPods instead. Super disappointed as I were really looking forward to the Pros and besides the comfort, all the other features were amazing!', 'Extremely disappointed it does hurt my ear and I never did have a issue like that before. I adore my AirPods and MTWs but will continue on with the Pros and hope maybe my ears will get used to them.', 'I don‚Äôt have the pros and can already guarantee they will be less comfortable for me. Anything with a rubber gasket thing that goes inside my ears is not that comfortable to me. AirPods/EarPods are the most comfortable ‚Äúin ear‚Äù headphones out there for me. I have zero need for the new pros. I have a pair of over ear anc headphones for airplanes and other over ear nicer cans for at home.', 'For some reason in my left ear it feels like it‚Äôs slipping out, it‚Äôs driving me crazy and I think I might have to return these :(', 'As not everybody is the same, some will find the regular ones better, others the Pro\'s. I hate that a lot of people say the Pro\'s ""are definitely a better fit"" when that entirely depends on the user. For me, the regular AirPods are almost perfect. The Pro\'s fit a bit less perfect. Still, I like the ANC a lot, so I think I\'m keeping them.', 'Ok definitely gonna try them in the store now‚Ä¶ \n\nCould Y‚Äôall get the feeling they were gonna hurt after 30 minutes when you first put them on (did they feel at all more uncomfortable?) or did it take a day of use to tell? \n\nI‚Äôm also quite nervous because I‚Äôm going to get mine engraved with my name, but then that means I can‚Äôt return them \n(I know the solution here is not to get them engraved but I like the engraving it‚Äôs a lowkey flex since a lot of people don‚Äôt know you can do that for free)', 'I agree with this but I have never been a fan of in ear earbuds', 'Yes. I was so close to returning the pros but suddenly after a few days they just started to feel comfortable. Yesterday I had them in while using the leaf blower and the noise cancelling was amazing so now I love them. I‚Äôd say just give it some more time and then decide.', 'I‚Äôve only used the Pros for about 15 minutes with the medium tips, but I agree. I guess I have the particular ear shape that AirPods were built for which means I can wear them all day and easily forget that they‚Äôre even in. AirPods Pro feel like normal IEMs ‚Äî not uncomfortable but always noticeable.', 'No.  Its not even close.  \n\nI loved the standard Airpods but could wear them for a few hours max before my ears would get sore.  The pros spend most of my work day in my ears.', 'You‚Äôre not alone. My AirPods 2 fit perfectly; never had an issue with them hurting my ears or falling out.  THESE (Pros) have introduced both issues for me, but only ‚Äúfalling out‚Äù for my wife.', 'No not at all,\nForgot I had my AirPod pros in the other day.\nAirPod pros are absolutely fantastic', 'Yeah same here I‚Äôm returning them. I usually wear my AirPods for 3+ hours at a time and these definitely hurt. Bummer because I love the air cancellation and features. Maybe I‚Äôll get the Sennheisers everyone is raving about.', 'i am very fortunate that my ears fit the original AirPods but i agree. everything seems muffled and transparency mode is too ""bright"" and feels weird, i like how the original airpods let me really be in the moment. also i lay down with my airpods and they can be flush against the pillow but the pros hurt if i do, so i think i will stick with the originals', 'Same here. Loved airpods 1 and really wanted to love the airpods pro but my right side started hurting on my right ear because I have bigger anti tragus', 'I returned mine for this reason. Was bummed, but they caused me pain after a relatively short amount of time using them no matter which tips I was using.', ""Not I. They feel better in my ears than the non-Pro AirPods did, and they stay in place better, too. I do, however, acknowledge that with all the diversity in human ear sizes and shapes out there, there's no way Apple could please everyone with the AirPods Pro."", 'The Pros are way more comfortable for me than the standards. But this all depends on a person‚Äôs ear shape.', 'Maybe it‚Äôs something to get used to, personally I have never worn AirPods Pro but they do look like they are suppose to be comfortable. It may depend on the shape or size of the ear.', 'All of the ‚Äútipped‚Äù earbuds always fell out of my ears immediately. Worried the AirPods pro would do the same. Regular AirPods are the only kind of earbuds that ever stayed in my ears. Ran a 10k with them.', 'They are about the same for me. The pros feel like a more secure fit though', 'i think pros are very comfortable. i wear them the entire 8 hour workday. yesterday before bed i was watching a video and fell asleep with my airpods in! my favorite apple product so far and i‚Äôm deep in its ecosystem.', ""used them for the full 14 days and just had to return them,  loved the products but they made my ears sore and felt like they'd fall out after an hour (even though they probably wouldn't)"", 'The small tips helped but yeah it‚Äôs definitely less comfortable to have something that far in creating a seal.', 'Absolutely not me. It‚Äôs super comfortable compared to all my other earbuds. Try to put it on properly. It took me two to three days to figure out.', 'You shut your mouth\n\n/s', 'Yeah they should of made over ear ones but they also own beats so I guess they didn‚Äôt want to go that route.', 'Truth be told, I think both types feel like shit.', 'Yes, but the pro is comfortable enough.\nZero noise management earbuds are just out of the question regardless of how comfortable it might be.']","Anyone else feel like the Airpods are MORE comfortable than the Airpods PRO?

I picked up the AirPods Pro at the Apple Store the moment it opened on Wednesday. I then immediately hopped on a flight from the US to Hong Kong - here are my thoughts:

**COMFORT**

YESSSSSSSSSS this is what I‚Äôve been dreaming of! I hated the big headphones when trying to rest my head against a pillow trying to sleep. I hated the AirPods falling out and me having to search the floor and my seat for them when I wake up and realized they were gone. I hated the QC20s because I would get tangled up in the wires. 

This is what I was looking for. Thank you, Apple.

**NOISE CANCELLATION**

Ok so this is why we‚Äôre all here, right? Noise cancellation was incredible. Honestly incredible. They were on par with the QC35s, and in some aspects, better. I found that it cancelled the background hum very slightly better than the QC35s, and also better at cancelling out voices - though I think this was more the isolation part than the active noise cancellation. With the Bose, if there is a cabin announcement or a flight attendant is talking to me, I‚Äôm usually aware of it enough to be able to know it‚Äôs going on and take off my headphones. With these, honestly, I often found myself not even aware - they were that good. 

Probably a flight attendants nightmare, but I did find myself being able to see when they were going through the aisles and put it into transparency mode. 

One big difference with noise - with the Bose, during takeoff, on some of the planes/engines that I fly (I fly 200k miles a year), I find that the noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt work well and it ends up making an awful noise for a few seconds, to the point where I sometimes have to take them off. There‚Äôs just some frequency that it doesn‚Äôt like. This was not an issue with the AirPods Pro. Additionally, when I rest my head against the side of the airplane to sleep with the Bose, the vibration often caused noise in the Bose. Not an issue with the AirPods Pro since they don‚Äôt stick out enough to hit the side of the plane. 

**USAGE WITH IFE**

Okay so this part is a bit more annoying. With the QC35s, I can just plug them into the IFE. For this, I had to use Twelve South‚Äôs AirFly. It works. It‚Äôs another thing to carry around and keep charged. But it works. 

**BATTERY LIFE**

OOOOOOOkey. So here‚Äôs where things go south. Battery life is dismal. A fully charged set, brand new, lasts 4.5 hours. My flight, after including boarding, taxi, takeoff, and landing, was well over 16 hours. That‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs unrealistic to get a 100% charge - in reality, it won‚Äôt be ever really fully charged since it charges much faster at lower %, and you‚Äôd have to wait much longer for a full charge than a 80% charge. So, on a 16 hour flight like mine, you‚Äôd have to charge like 5 times - and that‚Äôs what I did.

Thankfully, the charge time is relatively fast. I put it in the case every time I got up to go to the bathroom, and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. It would drop down to 10%, I‚Äôd get up to use the bathroom, walk around, stretch, get back and it‚Äôs charged to 50%. Workable, but really not great. It also means that you can‚Äôt keep listening to your entertainment while walking around the cabin, which I liked doing. 

I wish they had made it a bit longer like the original AirPods and improved the battery life instead. 

**CONCLUSION**

Okay so what does this mean: for short/medium haul flights, such as domestic USA flights, this replaces my Bose QC35. Period. I‚Äôm leaving that bulky case at home from now on. 

For long haul flights... it‚Äôs a bit tougher of a sell with the battery life where it is. On my flight here, I left the Bose in the case other than for the direct comparison, and it was a bit of a hassle. If the QC35 batteries die, you can still use them sans noise cancellation. If the AirPods Pro die, you‚Äôre SOL. I think for trips where I‚Äôm concerned about packing light, I‚Äôll forgo the Bose for the AirPods Pro, but if I have the space to spare, the Bose will still stay with me.",apple,AirPods Pro vs Bose QC35 on a 15 hour flight - my review,406,"['The solution for your battery problem is 2 pairs lol', 'I have a very hard time believing you when you say the noise cancelling is better than the Bose.

I picked up the AirPods Pro at the Apple Store the moment it opened on Wednesday. I then immediately hopped on a flight from the US to Hong Kong - here are my thoughts:

**COMFORT**

YESSSSSSSSSS this is what I‚Äôve been dreaming of! I hated the big headphones when trying to rest my head against a pillow trying to sleep. I hated the AirPods falling out and me having to search the floor and my seat for them when I wake up and realized they were gone. I hated the QC20s because I would get tangled up in the wires. 

This is what I was looking for. Thank you, Apple.

**NOISE CANCELLATION**

Ok so this is why we‚Äôre all here, right? Noise cancellation was incredible. Honestly incredible. They were on par with the QC35s, and in some aspects, better. I found that it cancelled the background hum very slightly better than the QC35s, and also better at cancelling out voices - though I think this was more the isolation part than the active noise cancellation. With the Bose, if there is a cabin announcement or a flight attendant is talking to me, I‚Äôm usually aware of it enough to be able to know it‚Äôs going on and take off my headphones. With these, honestly, I often found myself not even aware - they were that good. 

Probably a flight attendants nightmare, but I did find myself being able to see when they were going through the aisles and put it into transparency mode. 

One big difference with noise - with the Bose, during takeoff, on some of the planes/engines that I fly (I fly 200k miles a year), I find that the noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt work well and it ends up making an awful noise for a few seconds, to the point where I sometimes have to take them off. There‚Äôs just some frequency that it doesn‚Äôt like. This was not an issue with the AirPods Pro. Additionally, when I rest my head against the side of the airplane to sleep with the Bose, the vibration often caused noise in the Bose. Not an issue with the AirPods Pro since they don‚Äôt stick out enough to hit the side of the plane. 

**USAGE WITH IFE**

Okay so this part is a bit more annoying. With the QC35s, I can just plug them into the IFE. For this, I had to use Twelve South‚Äôs AirFly. It works. It‚Äôs another thing to carry around and keep charged. But it works. 

**BATTERY LIFE**

OOOOOOOkey. So here‚Äôs where things go south. Battery life is dismal. A fully charged set, brand new, lasts 4.5 hours. My flight, after including boarding, taxi, takeoff, and landing, was well over 16 hours. That‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs unrealistic to get a 100% charge - in reality, it won‚Äôt be ever really fully charged since it charges much faster at lower %, and you‚Äôd have to wait much longer for a full charge than a 80% charge. So, on a 16 hour flight like mine, you‚Äôd have to charge like 5 times - and that‚Äôs what I did.

Thankfully, the charge time is relatively fast. I put it in the case every time I got up to go to the bathroom, and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. It would drop down to 10%, I‚Äôd get up to use the bathroom, walk around, stretch, get back and it‚Äôs charged to 50%. Workable, but really not great. It also means that you can‚Äôt keep listening to your entertainment while walking around the cabin, which I liked doing. 

I wish they had made it a bit longer like the original AirPods and improved the battery life instead.

New top spec iPhone every year new top spec work MacBook Pro laptop every 3.5 years...I have the OG iPad Pro...daily Airpod user...I believe in Apple products and rely on them daily in my professional and personal life.

I was hoping these were going to be announced at the iPhone event in September.  Announcement hits that Airpods Pro are out earlier this week, and they were an instant preorder for me.  They arrived on 10/30.  I was so hopeful, these would be 'the ones'.

Bit of background: My Airpods are my goto when traveling around the city and for multiple work calls a day.  I truly believe that as a phone headset, there is nothing that comes close in the wireless domain.  I've learned to accept the audio quality for music, but the Airpods (2nd gen), are not going to 'move' you from an audio quality perspective, and I am totally fine with that.  I have other headphones (wired and wireless that I use when I want top notch audio quality)  Phone/business calls first, music second for this device...but due to sheer convenience they are in my ears more than any other headphones I own by a massive margin.

Here is my honest review of the Airpods Pro:

1. The case is about 10% larger, noticeable in close fitting jean pockets, this is an obvious one and easy to deal with
2. It is more than 'just a bit' more challenging to remove Airpods Pro from the new case.  I struggle to not drop them in a serious way versus the previous case and form factor.  I have similar problem putting them back in, the previous form factor was just robotic, in/out, boom no problems.  The way they fit in the case almost feels like it's the reverse of the way it was previously. This is a real tough one for me.
3. I believe I am in between the small and medium tips, size wise.  The ear tip test, passes for both small and mediums tips for me, yet there is a noticeable improvement in sound (music and calls) quality with the small tips.  The sounds is quite a bit improved over Airpods, but after 10ish mins of wear time, they seem to not maintain a tight seal.  Medium's remain tight but the sound quality is noticeably inferior and more 'tinny' and similar to the airpods.  Another tough one for me, but not a universal issue.
4. I ride my bike, and boosted rev with my Airpods in...the play/stop and skip functions are all accessible by simply single or double tapping the Airpods...the new mechanic of having to grab on to the stem is much, much more cumbersome, and clumsy, especially when moving.  Previously just take your knuckle and tap away.  This existing mechanic wins by a long shot over the stem squeezes.
5. NYC winter is approaching, gloves are required.  The stem mechanic becomes then again more clumsy with gloves on, I've tested this with my biking gloves (very little bulk to these gloves) and while it's workable, it's inferior to the previous generation and with more bulky gloves getting that stem press just right is challenging
6. The sound quality is definitely improved throughout the spectrum...lows still leave you wanting, but mids and highs are improved over the Airpods...At 250 dollars you are at the same price point of another pair of in ear full wireless: The Sennheiser Momentum true wireless which have magically wonderful sound quality, but are really not so great when talking on the phone.  Yes they are large, and can get uncomfortable after extended wear, but they are the top IMO for in ear true wireless audio quality.  I digress.
7. Noise cancelling is really quite good.  Transparency mode is cary good.  I own the Sony WH1000XM3 and it's tough to compare Airpods Pro to over the ear ANC cans, but I'm happy with the active noise cancelling and with the transparency mode, transparency mode is astonishingly good, to the point it feels like you have super hearing.  I was ordering food with transparency on, and while in line, could very distinctly hear a conversation a customer was having with the cashier 10-15 feet away from me.  I would likely put the transparency mode of the Airpods Pro in a tier slightly above the XM3s.
8. The shorter stem length is nice aesthetically, but really lacking functionally.  The beauty of the long stems on the Airpods was you could so quickly just snag them out of your ear.  Walking down the street in NYC and someone comes up to you asking for directions...fumbling with the squeezing stem mechanic, or using your phone to turn on transparency is awkward and not instant...plucking the airpod out of your ear by the stem is instant.

Most of the issues I'm experiencing are mostly coming from the previous generation.  Perhaps if you did not use the previous generation day to day, much of this would be non-relevant.  My guess is a large portion of consumers are coming from the previous generation though.  Rock and hard place as to whether or not I will keep them at this point.

I own neither though they have been on my wishlist for a while. \n\nPersonally I just thought that the AirPods pro look nicer. They look more balanced proportionally compared to the long stem of the AirPods. However after reading your review I am now in two minds in terms of the usability aspect.', 'I got mine today and I agree completely with everything you‚Äôve said. The ANC works well and the sound quality is great, but they are awkward to get out of the case and having to hold the stems to change songs, etc is more cumbersome than tapping. \n\nI‚Äôm also very aware when they‚Äôre in my ears, whereas I could easily forget I was wearing the original AirPods.

More good than bad. I can see myself truly leaving these in until the batteries tell me I have to remove them. I so pleased!', 'Didn‚Äôt Tim Cook recently announce that these are not a replacement for Apple AirPods. I was confused by that statement until I tried the pros out. I don‚Äôt think these are meant for biking or exercising. These are for walks to the office, or grocery store. For listening to podcasts or audiobooks or that long flight. \n\nThey might bring the taps back but for now I have no issues using my AirPods first gen for biking/exercising and then using these as my get around town stuff.', 'Hi! I‚Äôm a pretty die-hard Apple user and I love my 2nd Gen AirPods. One of the best selling points for me would probably be the size. To me, the current AirPods are small and light. However, I will be lying down and my AirPod is just a liiiiiiitle too big. It causes discomfort when lying down so I think I might upgrade to the Pro‚Äôs. Personally I thing that making them smaller was a good idea. The voice cancelling is genius. I hate that you can hear everything around you when listening to music with the AirPods. Noise Cancelling will be huge for me', 'It‚Äôs funny, I didn‚Äôt want to admit how hard it is to take them out of and put them back in the case.  I feel like I can‚Äôt really get a grip on them properly, but I‚Äôm probably doing it wrong.\n\nI also find I‚Äôm using ask Siri more and more because the stem tapping isn‚Äôt as useful,', 'I agree with all of this. \n\nI live in Boston and winter/gloves hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind. You‚Äôre absolutely right, the clicking is going to be much more difficult that just tapping was. Ôøº\n\nI also hope some third parties create foam ear tips at some point. Apple missed the mark with the fit/seal on there. Which is incredibly disappointing.', 'This is the first real review of the AirPods I feel like I wholeheartedly agree with. \n\nI have both the first and second generation AirPods because they are so deeply integrated in my life. I preordered the AirPods Pro and will be returning them next week because of pretty much the exact list of reasons you gave. \n\nThe AirPods Pro is nowhere near as convenient as the normal AirPods - the case is clunky (I can‚Äôt believe no reviewer has mentioned how much harder it is to use compared to the normal case), it takes longer to put them on and remove them, the seals aren‚Äôt as comfortable as having no seal on the standard AirPods. All these tiny little things really matter so much when you use the AirPods frequently like I do. \n\nThe improved sound quality and the incredible noise cancellation are noted (the transparency mode and the ANC are very impressive), but these aren‚Äôt the fundamental reasons why I use AirPods. It‚Äôs all about the convenience, and the AirPods Pro sacrifice a lot of convenience for the sake of ANC and sound quality. \n\nI current swap between standard AirPods (used 80% of the time) and Bose QC35 (used 20% of the time when ANC is required). It‚Äôs a better combo than the AirPods Pro.\n\nI feel like most reviewers are failing to realise that the AirPods Pro are a downgrade from AirPods if you judge it based off convenience, which is why most people get AirPods.', 'Yes I agree, this is why I won‚Äôt be getting these.', 'I really like the Pros, but they aren‚Äôt completely replacing my AirPods. I might even use my gen2‚Äôs more often overall, but there are plenty of times where the Pros will work much better because of ANC. It‚Äôs not either/or for me.', 'I love that you can turn on/off ANC via Siri which is nice.', 'I completely agree that they are harder to remove from the case. I‚Äôm hoping I get used to it. I also agree that the stem button is more cumbersome; however I‚Äôm split on it because I feel like it‚Äôs more elegant. Tapping my ears never felt right, and I especially feel like it would be weird with the in ear design. \n\nMy biggest worry right now is that they fall out easier than my old AirPods. Those babies really fit my ear and these fall out whenever I‚Äôm eating. I guess the chewing moves my head enough to dislodge them. Overall I like the new ones a lot, but they aren‚Äôt perfect for me right now.', 'I disagree with number 2, I just pull them by the rubber ear tip and have zero problems removing them from the case', ""Thank you for your review! When I first saw them released, I questioned their worth and was met with hostility here. It seems they perform excellently in terms of the audio itself and the ANC, but I am surprised to see that things like taking them out of the case and using skip track/mute/pause functions are rather cumbersome. Usually Apple goes all in when it comes to their products (except iPod touch, barely still alive) and it's strange that they'd miss things like that."", 'I agree with a lot of what you said (not all of it, however). One thing I‚Äôll point out is that the Pros are more uncomfortable than the first generation. They kind of hurt my ears.', 'I‚Äôm working through some of the things I really don‚Äôt like (getting in and out of the case, time getting in and out of ears) but the thing I don‚Äôt know that I will get past is the lack of tap controls. One thing I loved was the tap would work even if wearing snowboard helmets or bike helmets. You would only have to tap the helmet and the AirPods would pick it up. Didn‚Äôt matter if you were wearing heavy gloves or what. Not looking forward to using these in winter with gloves. I really hope they reintroduce rapping as an option for play and pause.', 'I use my AirPods when watching shows in bed, on my sid. Head against my pillow. \n\nThey fit snug, and don‚Äôt create any pressure points or anything. \n\nHow do you think the pros would be in that scenario ?', 'One thing you didn‚Äôt cover is that if you pull one APP out it will pause content (just like before) and will also put the other into transparency mode.  \nThis is honestly better for me than previous AirPods (Gen 1, FWIW).  \n  \nAlso, I personally prefer the squeeze gesture, but my climate doesn‚Äôt ever require gloves and I don‚Äôt jog/run.  \n  \nLastly, with medium tips my APP did not budge for me over the course of a full charge. For others I‚Äôm sure it will, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion for every user.  \n  \nEdit: the case is definitely a pain, to place/remove the Pros from. Though I found the size difference to be extremely negligible.', 'Absolute disagree here. I think they‚Äôre one of the best products I‚Äôve ever owned, period. And one of the best products Apple has ever released.', 'Complaining about airpods being clumsy with gloves on in winter,  wow some people will complain about anything,  \nAnd the one when someone ask you for directions and you fumble with the shorter stem, are you serious, I would bet that has never ever ever happened to you']","Airpods Pro: An honest (and lengthy) review from an Apple devotee Please know...I am an apple devotee in a real way.  New top spec iPhone every year new top spec work MacBook Pro laptop every 3.5 years...I have the OG iPad Pro...daily Airpod user...I believe in Apple products and rely on them daily in my professional and personal life.

I was hoping these were going to be announced at the iPhone event in September.  Announcement hits that Airpods Pro are out earlier this week, and they were an instant preorder for me.  They arrived on 10/30.  I was so hopeful, these would be 'the ones'.

Bit of background: My Airpods are my goto when traveling around the city and for multiple work calls a day.  I truly believe that as a phone headset, there is nothing that comes close in the wireless domain.  I've learned to accept the audio quality for music, but the Airpods (2nd gen), are not going to 'move' you from an audio quality perspective, and I am totally fine with that.  I have other headphones (wired and wireless that I use when I want top notch audio quality)  Phone/business calls first, music second for this device...but due to sheer convenience they are in my ears more than any other headphones I own by a massive margin.

Here is my honest review of the Airpods Pro:

1. The case is about 10% larger, noticeable in close fitting jean pockets, this is an obvious one and easy to deal with
2. It is more than 'just a bit' more challenging to remove Airpods Pro from the new case.  I struggle to not drop them in a serious way versus the previous case and form factor.  I have similar problem putting them back in, the previous form factor was just robotic, in/out, boom no problems.  The way they fit in the case almost feels like it's the reverse of the way it was previously. This is a real tough one for me.
3. I believe I am in between the small and medium tips, size wise.  The ear tip test, passes for both small and mediums tips for me, yet there is a noticeable improvement in sound (music and calls) quality with the small tips.  The sounds is quite a bit improved over Airpods, but after 10ish mins of wear time, they seem to not maintain a tight seal.  Medium's remain tight but the sound quality is noticeably inferior and more 'tinny' and similar to the airpods.  Another tough one for me, but not a universal issue.
4. I ride my bike, and boosted rev with my Airpods in...the play/stop and skip functions are all accessible by simply single or double tapping the Airpods...the new mechanic of having to grab on to the stem is much, much more cumbersome, and clumsy, especially when moving.  Previously just take your knuckle and tap away.  This existing mechanic wins by a long shot over the stem squeezes.
5. NYC winter is approaching, gloves are required.  The stem mechanic becomes then again more clumsy with gloves on, I've tested this with my biking gloves (very little bulk to these gloves) and while it's workable, it's inferior to the previous generation and with more bulky gloves getting that stem press just right is challenging
6. The sound quality is definitely improved throughout the spectrum...lows still leave you wanting, but mids and highs are improved over the Airpods...At 250 dollars you are at the same price point of another pair of in ear full wireless: The Sennheiser Momentum true wireless which have magically wonderful sound quality, but are really not so great when talking on the phone.  Yes they are large, and can get uncomfortable after extended wear, but they are the top IMO for in ear true wireless audio quality.  I digress.
7. Noise cancelling is really quite good.  Transparency mode is cary good.  I own the Sony WH1000XM3 and it's tough to compare Airpods Pro to over the ear ANC cans, but I'm happy with the active noise cancelling and with the transparency mode, transparency mode is astonishingly good, to the point it feels like you have super hearing.  I was ordering food with transparency on, and while in line, could very distinctly hear a conversation a customer was having with the cashier 10-15 feet away from me.  I would likely put the transparency mode of the Airpods Pro in a tier slightly above the XM3s.
8. The shorter stem length is nice aesthetically, but really lacking functionally.  The beauty of the long stems on the Airpods was you could so quickly just snag them out of your ear.  Walking down the street in NYC and someone comes up to you asking for directions...fumbling with the squeezing stem mechanic, or using your phone to turn on transparency is awkward and not instant...plucking the airpod out of your ear by the stem is instant.

Most of the issues I'm experiencing are mostly coming from the previous generation.  Perhaps if you did not use the previous generation day to day, much of this would be non-relevant.  My guess is a large portion of consumers are coming from the previous generation though.  Rock and hard place as to whether or not I will keep them at this point.

Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.

https://imgur.com/a/FkBRRAm

Let's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:

**Active Noise Cancellation**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **N/A** 
* WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8/10**
* WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10/10**

Hands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect.

**Sound Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **8/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **9.5/10**

The in-ear Sony's win this one easily - the sound is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. Sony nailed the audio quality on these, whereas the Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1/2.

**Comfort**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **6.5/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**

The shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them.

**Battery Life**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**

Not very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge.

**Connectivity**

* AirPods Pro: **10/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7.5/10**

Both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone.

**Call Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **5/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**

AirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here.

**Case Size/Pocketability**

* AirPods Pro: **9.5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **3/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **5/10**

While slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable.

**Workout/Gym**

* AirPods Pro: **8/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7/10**

Personally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder.

Ultimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality.

Hope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!",apple,AirPods Pro vs. Powerbeats Pro vs. WF-1000XM3 (Bonus: vs. WH-1000XM3),1286,"[""I love these reviews... one an hour ago says the AirPods Pro ANC smashes his WF-1000XM3's, and now this one is saying the total opposite. That's not even something that can be subjective, like sound quality, can it?

The WFs just have a sense of natural clarity and just absolute perfect tonality to them and I'm willing to forgo issues such as a relatively larger case and not-so-seamless pairing just to have sound quality that puts a smile on my face.\n\nMaybe that's just me."", 'Nice comprehensive review.  I think the best combo (although pricy) is the AirPod pros for everyday carry, workouts and the WH over the ear headphones for times when you want the best sound quality/noise cancellation.  So many people don‚Äôt think about the portability aspect.  AirPods are a really great all purpose earbud and I think Apple knocked this one out of the park for the average user.', 'Does anyone have the Beats X and Airpods Pro. I want to know whether the Airpods have better or worse sound quality than the beats x', ""I'll be honest, I was passing the apple store yesterday with my wife and we had some time to kill.

I watch my wife look surprised, and then laugh as the guy is trying to explain things to her but she can't even hear him. \n\nThey mess around with transparency mode etc and she comes away really impressed \n\nSo I ask for a go, warning him I have higher expectations from my Sonys. Well, I put them on and he plays some music, and starts the same demo process, and I can't hear a damn word he's saying.  It took me going down to a very low volume before I could. \n\nNow, I was kind of shocked that some buds could manage that. I'm definitely impressed. \n\nThe only issue is, I can get Sony WF 1000XM3 for adou d ¬£150 so when he told me they were ¬£250 it pretty much ended the conversation\n\nAlso still keen to try Amazon echo buds just to see if they're good enough for ¬£119 \n\nAnyway..

It seems once again Apple pulls me in because of the ecosystem -- having the potential to audio share is a huge pull for me because if it wasn't for that I'd probably get the WF-1000XM3 because I was won over by my WH-1000XM3"", ""I'm returning my AirPod Pros. The biggest problem is with the sound quality. It really lacked depth. Instruments like a grand piano sounded more like an upright piano. So for me, a lot of the emotions are lost in how artists sing or play instruments.\n\nAlso, the problem I think is mainly the AirPod Pros don't really seal in the ear canal. They seal outside of the canal. They kind of float in the cup of the ear and so the sound isn't completely isolated."", ""I've had the same experience between the APP and the WF XM3's, almost to the tee, that you describe above. The sound is a bit better, the noise cancelling is a bit better, and since I'd have to pay for shipping to return them, it's kind of like in the NFL, I don't have enough to overturn the call. I think if the APP came out before I bought the Sony's, I'd be just fine with them as I really wish the XM3s had multi-device pairing, and that transparency on the APPs is LEGIT, but given that I already have Airpods and Beatsx that would lose a lot on their resale, I'm just going to return the APP's and keep my specialization between the three going."", 'You should review the Amazon echo buds next!

The fact that I only charge these once every two weeks or so should make the battery last quite a while.', 'As an audiophile, the sound quality on both the Pros and the Sony sound about the same to me. But the reason why I prefer the Pros over the Sony is because they do a cleaner job with ANC. Meaning there‚Äôs no static hissing noise when I turn up the volume. When I listen to music on my Sonys, I can hear slight digital intrusiveness and a tiny bit of static, whereas I don‚Äôt hear any of that at all on the Pros. The Pros‚Äô transparency mode is also a lot more natural than my Sonys. I can tell that it‚Äôs digitally enhanced when I use my Sonys, but hear substantially less intrusion on my Pros.', 'I personally had the WF1000XM3s.

I would be worried about the Sonys getting drowned after a while as well, so I ordered the new AirPods.

No one could hear me and it sounded like I was under water. Also hated the case. Bulky and the lid was thin plastic / not metallic. \n\nThe sound was fantastic though.', 'Not sure how long you have owned or tested the WH-1000XM3‚Äôs, but as an owner of the headphones for over a year, I strongly disagree with the assessment of their ANC.\n\nWhen I first purchased the headphones, the ANC was incredible, even without running their optimizer. However, in the year of owning them, I have noticed several issues.\n\n1) ANC seems to rely on both the quality of the seal the ear cups make with you ears, and more importantly, the clamping force\n\n2) Over time, the clamping force has significantly degraded. Some people might believe that this enhances the comfort, but they were never really uncomfortable to begin with. If I activity press down both ear cups with my hands, all of the sudden, the ANC works. Before you ask, yes, I have run the optimizer many times, it doesn‚Äôt help.\n\n3) Speaking of the headband, it creaks when you spread the ear cups (needed to put them over your head), for headphones that cost $350 ($480 after GeekSquad and tax), this is absurd. Sony really should be using a metal headband which retains its clamping force over time, especially since the ANC relies on it so heavily. And prior versions of these headphones are known for breaking because of this, so I fully expect it to happen within the next few months.\n\n4) Whenever I get a haircut, the ANC gets better. The quality of the ANC should absolutely not be dependent on how much hair is around my ears. If I had long hair I couldn‚Äôt see these working at all.\n\n5) Since everything is plastic, the headphones creak whenever I move my jaw or turn my head. This comes through in audio and ruins the illusion.\n\n6) ANC just doesn‚Äôt work with any kind of white noise, such as a nearby ac unit, fan, kitchen sink, rain, etc. It also does a bad job at drowning out voices.\n\n7) the ANC seems to work better with bass heavy music, but I would like to cancel out background noise while listening to podcasts or youtube videos in public. The headphones don‚Äôt work for this case.\n\n8) The ANC was great when I first got tue headphones. Points 6 and 7 were no an issue. Heck, I could flush the toilet, start the sink, garbage disposal, dryer, etc, etc and not hear any of it with ANC. That isn‚Äôt true anymore. Point 5 also wasn‚Äôt a problem out of the box.\n\n9) You know turning the ANC on causes your ears to not quite pop, but feel like they are under pressure? This is without audio playing back, btw. That‚Äôs how you know the ANC works. Well, that doesn‚Äôt happen anymore...\n\n10) Touch controls are cool and all, but they misregister touch events all the time in tue cold or when there is wind, even with a hoody over top. Forget pausing audio by double tapping, even after entering a building, it‚Äôs not happening. Use your phone. \n\nCan‚Äôt wait until either these break (better happen within two years of the purchase though), or an over-ear alternative comes around that is even better. I know Bose has an alternative, but they also have the stupid touch controls and some either minor issues that keep me from switching.

Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.

https://imgur.com/a/FkBRRAm

Let's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:

**Active Noise Cancellation**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **N/A** 
* WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8/10**
* WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10/10**

Hands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect.

**Sound Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **8/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **9.5/10**

The in-ear Sony's win this one easily - the sound is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. Sony nailed the audio quality on these, whereas the Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1/2.

**Comfort**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **6.5/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**

The shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them.

**Battery Life**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**

Not very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge.

**Connectivity**

* AirPods Pro: **10/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7.5/10**

Both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone.

**Call Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **5/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**

AirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here.

**Case Size/Pocketability**

* AirPods Pro: **9.5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **3/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **5/10**

While slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable.

**Workout/Gym**

* AirPods Pro: **8/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7/10**

Personally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder.

Ultimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality.

Hope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!",31,1037,89,"[4, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 11, 1, 11, 2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 6, 3, 6, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 6, 33, 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 3, 7, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 5, 6, 6, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 10, 4, 1, 3, 7, 2, 1, 5, 4, 14, 2, 4, 1, 6, 2, 4, 6, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]","[83, 7, 26, 131, 76, 27, 270, 3, 187, 52, 98, 148, 25, 36, 82, 47, 133, 93, 122, 87, 107, 28, 114, 54, 670, 32, 112, 175, 3, 14, 38, 128, 17, 19, 30, 63, 54, 89, 126, 118, 52, 23, 28, 20, 49, 34, 103, 5, 70, 28, 17, 9, 116, 9, 25, 27, 5, 41, 11, 100, 107, 11, 59, 277, 54, 24, 103, 118, 110, 73, 78, 14, 72, 22, 51, 92, 42, 100, 15, 17, 39, 13, 22, 174, 26, 29, 10, 3, 20]",3.966292134831461,70.46067415730337

SOUND QUALITY  
The Sonys wins this one I'm sorry to say. The base is much better and the whole soundspace seems bigger and ""roomier"". But the Airpods Pro are still miles ahead of the old airpods, though. All in all they have a very nice sound and I am going to sell my Sonys and use the pros as my only in-ear set.

NOISE CANCELLATION   
The Airpods Pro wins this one. They really surpriced me here. I was expecting them to be near the Sonys but IMHO the are better. They completely cancel out the aircon/motor of my car inside the cabin where as the Sonys cancels most of it but still leaves a faint hiss. I would go as far as saying they are very close to my over ear Bose QC35s, which is really really impressive for such small devices.

FIT & Comfort  
The Airpods Pro wins by a mile here. The Sonys make a tight seal but also gives you the feeling of being inside a bubble. When I first put the Airpods in my ears i though I hadn't pushed them ""into the ear"" far enough. They felt very light and almost like they weren't in the ear. But then the ANC kicked in and it was complete silence, but with the strange feeling of NOT having something stuffed into your ear canal. VERY impressive, Apple.

TRANSPARENCY & AMBIENT SOUND MODES  
Again - the Airpods wins here. With the Sonys on Ambient Sound mode they let outside noise in, but if you're trying to have a conversation with someone it sounds strange. My own voice is ""off"" and i find myself speaking way too loudly to the person in front of me. I always end taking the Sonys out even for short interactions. The airpods on the other hand - maybe because of the airway thing doesn't give you a strange feel and doesn't make your own voice sound weird. I can have a much more natural interaction with a cashier or make a short remark to a coworker.

TLDR; Sonys have (IMHO) slightly better sound, but Airpods wins out in ANC, comfort and transparency mode, so I'm selling my Sonys and keeping the Airpods. Also - i don't expect the airpods to have connection problems or any lag watching youtube/netflix, like the Sonys do.

I've seen a couple other posts of impressions so I'll try to cover stuff that hasn't already been done to death. Feel free to ask questions.

* **Apple Store:** Hot tip: If you buy them in-store, set them up next to the line of display iPhones. Absolutely hilarious to watch a full line of iPhones pop up the setup box in sync. When you press connect on yours, all the other ones will switch to ""Not your AirPods Pro."" If that's not a ""pro"" experience, I don't know what is lol.
* **General Comfort:** I liked the original AirPods because they felt invisible and was a little worried about these, especially because earbuds like my Jabra Elite Active 65t buds take a little finagling to get them in right and get a seal, and when you do, there's pressure. AirPods Pro really surprised me. The tips feel excellent, *almost* invisible once they're in, and I didn't have to adjust at all to get a good seal. The Ear Tip Test is cool, very quick, and to my surprise confirmed I did get a good seal. That vent makes a massive difference in comfort, holy shit. Also, small note, but they look much nicer in ear than regular AirPods. Stem is way less noticeable.
* **Sound Quality:** If you like the way AirPods sound, you'll like these more because of the seal and reduced outside noise. Bass hits a little harder, you notice a little more detail in songs, etc. If you don't like how AirPods sound, you'll like these a little more but they won't blow you away. It's what you'd expect, nothing crazy. *EDIT: Had more time to test the sound quality. It's actually a bigger step up than I thought previously (I was mostly paying attention to ANC quality). The seal makes a big difference but honestly the drivers are just better.*
* **Subway and Street Noise:** This is the noisiest city I've ever been in. Near the Apple Store there's a lot of construction going on near the subway‚Äîjackhammers, construction workers, huge trucks, just really annoying chaos. I walked to the Apple Store wearing my regular AirPods and it was not fun but it's what I'm used to with them. Walking back to the subway with AirPods Pro cut a *ton* of the noise. I could still hear some of it obviously but suddenly I wasn't annoyed. When I got to the subway, I walked down the steps and saw that the opposite direction train was already there, just started to turn around to see when my train would arrive, and then WHOOSH, it flew by me, arriving. I literally didn't hear it *at all*. That's crazy. All I could hear was Kanye. On the subway itself, I couldn't really hear anybody around me and could barely hear the train. I switched to a podcast and it was like having the people and train at 20% volume. With normal AirPods on the subway I'd listen to podcast at like 80-90% volume; with the Pro I literally turned it *down* to about 50-60%. Amazing. Then on the walk home, I couldn't hear anybody on the street despite seeing people chatting or talking on their phone (on speakerphone of course). It was great.
* **Jeans Coin Pocket Test:** Saw some people worried about this as well. I can confirm that these *do* fit in my jeans coin pocket *better* than the old AirPods. The case for the old ones was more squarish, so I always had to kinda *push* it in a little bit. The Pro case on the other hand is long and narrow so you just turn it to the side and it slips in super easily. [I took a quick video here.](https://imgur.com/CeJwTUm)
* **Negatives:** They're white so the case still picked up lint from my jeans which is annoying but oh well, the controls definitely take a hot minute to get used to, and again, the sound quality isn't gonna blow you away if you didn't already like the way AirPods sound. So far those are my only negatives.

Obviously it hasn't been that long but I was literally grinning while walking home because suddenly NYC wasn't as loud and annoying anymore and I could actually hear my music and hear myself think. I'm super happy with these so far.",apple,"AirPods Pro impressions from NYC: subway noise, coins pocket test, comfort and more",5293,"['I like how the tips have their own mesh so wax doesn‚Äôt get on to the actual AirPod grill as easily and they can be replaced when there‚Äôs too much buildup', 'This is consistent with my NYC AirPods Pro experience as well.', 'I‚Äôm looking forward to trying them out today in the store.\n\nThe EarPods and previous AirPods didn‚Äôt fit in my ears.

My commute is just... well, there\'s  more \\*peace\\* in my life now.\n\nI\'ve owned the Bose QC35\'s for a couple of years, but they\'re big cans, and a big deal to bring and put on/off that I usually just don\'t bother. And you\'re just always aware you\'re wearing a big clunky thing on your head.\n\nBut these... after a few seconds, you forget you\'re wearing \\*anything\\*. The craziest thing is, they\'re actually more comfortable than any other in-ear earbuds I\'ve ever had. The other ones you kind of ""jam"" in to create a seal and so there\'s always this constant pressure. But these ones just rest gently there, zero pressure.\n\nThey\'re not cheap, but when I assume they\'ll be significantly improving the quality of my NYC commute daily for the next 3-4 years? Feels worth it. (Bought the $29 AppleCare too, assuming it means I\'ll swap them out for a new pair free a little before they\'re 2 years old, since I figure the battery will have degraded enough by then to make them eligible.)', ""One thing I wonder about these is mic/call sound quality. When someone calls me using their (amateur?) AirPods, they seem to amplify the higher-pitched ambient noises.

Yes i know Bose headphones aren't the best audio headphones but I travel and dont want open-back headphones. The truth is I think we all need to give them about a week to fully break in the drivers and open them open. I'm not disappointed but its not pure sexy magic, yet. There is a good amount of boom in the bass but its pretty clean sounding. Bass/Highs sound good, mids are muffled but I will revisit once they have been broken in.\n\nMy buddy beside me as the Beat Pro and we both like these better.

Honestly I think Apple hit it out of the park.  I can already tell the pros are going to be my new favorite headphones.  I have Bose QC35s and I think the AirPods pro sound better than the Bose.  I also own the OG AirPods to compare these too.  I was never impressed with OG AirPods sound quality and only used them for convenience.

Personally I like to push the bass and highs a little while keeping mode the same (rock or r&b on Spotify) which really transforms the sound for me \n- ANC is good, as others have said it doesn‚Äôt block all noise but is most effective while playing music and at low frequencies \n\nI like a good sound, and will happily leave my large cans at home now, even when going on holiday.', ""This post was worth it simply for the hot tip!

You forget what quiet sounds like when you live here for so long. \n\nSame deal with the train, too. I got a bad habit of cranking the volume up way too loud to compete with all the noise underground, it was so pleasant and slightly surreal to have a train pull up to the station and not even notice until the crowds are walking past you to board. \n\nAnd it fits so much better in my ears, with the rubber tips and all.

I should mention that my condo is right next to a construction site across the street (construction happens only during the work week but I‚Äôm almost never home during the day).  Today I‚Äôm listening to my podcast at my desk by the window and when I toggle the ANC and Transparency it is like night and day!

I am trying very hard to justify keeping the APP since I already own the BWP ....I do love the APP in the few hours I‚Äôve had them.  The biggest pros the APP have over the BWP are the size of the charging case, the ANC and the APP are way more comfortable to wear than the BWP.  (The Beats Wireless Pro were really uncomfortable in the beginning but i did get used to them and they are not so bad now).  Now I can listen to my Beats for up to 4 hours without any discomfort.  \n\nThe sound quality for both the APP and the BWP are around the same.  They both sound pretty good....I am not a hard core audiophile but I do know when something sounds really good to my ears.  \n\nThe biggest pro with the BWP over the APP is the long battery life (9 hours with a single charge for the BWP vs 4.5 hours single charge with ANC on the APP).  Just listening to the APP for about 45 minutes straight with ANC turned on and I‚Äôm already down to 80% battery which I guess is par for the course.  I usually listen to my BWP while at work and I‚Äôd rarely put the headphones into the case to charge because I wouldn‚Äôt need to.  If I keep these APP as my headphones to listen to at work, I‚Äôll have to remind myself to stick them in the case when I‚Äôm not using them.\n\nOne more thing I wanted to add (sorry for the rambly post), I tried the original AirPods when they came out and I returned them after a week because it did not fit my ears well (always felt like they would fall out) and I didn‚Äôt think the sound quality was very good.

I've seen a couple other posts of impressions so I'll try to cover stuff that hasn't already been done to death. Feel free to ask questions.

* **Apple Store:** Hot tip: If you buy them in-store, set them up next to the line of display iPhones. Absolutely hilarious to watch a full line of iPhones pop up the setup box in sync. When you press connect on yours, all the other ones will switch to ""Not your AirPods Pro."" If that's not a ""pro"" experience, I don't know what is lol.
* **General Comfort:** I liked the original AirPods because they felt invisible and was a little worried about these, especially because earbuds like my Jabra Elite Active 65t buds take a little finagling to get them in right and get a seal, and when you do, there's pressure. AirPods Pro really surprised me. The tips feel excellent, *almost* invisible once they're in, and I didn't have to adjust at all to get a good seal. The Ear Tip Test is cool, very quick, and to my surprise confirmed I did get a good seal. That vent makes a massive difference in comfort, holy shit. Also, small note, but they look much nicer in ear than regular AirPods. Stem is way less noticeable.
* **Sound Quality:** If you like the way AirPods sound, you'll like these more because of the seal and reduced outside noise. Bass hits a little harder, you notice a little more detail in songs, etc. If you don't like how AirPods sound, you'll like these a little more but they won't blow you away. It's what you'd expect, nothing crazy. *EDIT: Had more time to test the sound quality. It's actually a bigger step up than I thought previously (I was mostly paying attention to ANC quality). The seal makes a big difference but honestly the drivers are just better.*
* **Subway and Street Noise:** This is the noisiest city I've ever been in. Near the Apple Store there's a lot of construction going on near the subway‚Äîjackhammers, construction workers, huge trucks, just really annoying chaos. I walked to the Apple Store wearing my regular AirPods and it was not fun but it's what I'm used to with them. Walking back to the subway with AirPods Pro cut a *ton* of the noise. I could still hear some of it obviously but suddenly I wasn't annoyed. When I got to the subway, I walked down the steps and saw that the opposite direction train was already there, just started to turn around to see when my train would arrive, and then WHOOSH, it flew by me, arriving. I literally didn't hear it *at all*. That's crazy. All I could hear was Kanye. On the subway itself, I couldn't really hear anybody around me and could barely hear the train. I switched to a podcast and it was like having the people and train at 20% volume. With normal AirPods on the subway I'd listen to podcast at like 80-90% volume; with the Pro I literally turned it *down* to about 50-60%. Amazing. Then on the walk home, I couldn't hear anybody on the street despite seeing people chatting or talking on their phone (on speakerphone of course). It was great.
* **Jeans Coin Pocket Test:** Saw some people worried about this as well. I can confirm that these *do* fit in my jeans coin pocket *better* than the old AirPods. The case for the old ones was more squarish, so I always had to kinda *push* it in a little bit. The Pro case on the other hand is long and narrow so you just turn it to the side and it slips in super easily. [I took a quick video here.](https://imgur.com/CeJwTUm)
* **Negatives:** They're white so the case still picked up lint from my jeans which is annoying but oh well, the controls definitely take a hot minute to get used to, and again, the sound quality isn't gonna blow you away if you didn't already like the way AirPods sound.

He never connected it to a computer with iTunes or used iCloud to back it up. We now have the correct PIN and want to know if there is a way to unlock it without erasing everything.\n\nThe phone is an iPhone 6. Is there any way to unlock it now and at least get the contacts? Jailbreaking? Anything?', ""Is there a way to really turn off News app notifications?  I have them disabled, but this morning it still woke me up with an advertisement for white supremacists that wear mullets beating up on some other group of the same.  Apple, I don't care about that.

This was even worse than the Jennifer Aniston garbage they pushed a few weeks ago where they decided it was more important we read about her than sleep."", 'I‚Äôm having a strange (to me anyway) issue with the purchase of my new phone and the trade-in of my iPhone X. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nWhen I ordered my new phone (11 Pro Max) from the Apple website, it asked if I had a phone to trade in. I selected yes, and was asked which phone and what condition. This indicated the traded phone would reduce the amount of the loan by the value of the trade in (you can still see this one the Apple [website](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11-pro)):\n\n$24.95/month or $599 for the 11 Pro or \n$29.12/month  or $699 for the 11 Pro Max\n\nNot wanting to deal with eBay buyers this seemed like a great option. My new phone arrived on launch day, and a few days later a box arrived to send off my iPhone X in trade. I sent off the iPhone X, and a couple of weeks later I got an email saying ‚Äúyour trade in is complete, your old loan has been closed.‚Äù This made no sense to me so I called Apple. \n\nI‚Äôll make a really long story short by saying I have talked to two people at Apple, one of them was a callback from a manager. I am being told the process worked as intended. My trade in was used to satisfy the loan for my iPhone X (which was already paid for at that point). Essentially, I got zero value from the trade in and my iPhone X is gone. The manager told me this is how it was supposed to work and there is nothing that can be done. \n\nHas anyone encountered this or heard about other s with a similar situation?', ""This isn't a tech support issue, but does anyone know what time Apple TV+ will launch tomorrow?

I am a very concerned user, and while I have never shared a criticism of anyone or anything publicly (especially on social media channels), I have found myself forced into a position of doing so with you folks for the first time.

I have used Apple products since well before the days of your famous tag line ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù. Because... quite frankly ‚Äúit just did‚Äù. Microsoft, Google and others could be seen as only a far-away blur in your review mirror. Steve Jobs ran your company to perfection. And I believe everyone will have to admit, that although people may not have liked Mr. Jobs personally and he may have been tough to work for, during his tenure - Apple products ‚Äújust worked‚Äù. 

Now under Mr. Cook‚Äôs tenure, things have changed. While I believe the innovation is still alive and well at Apple, I believe your execution is nearly dead.

From bad keyboards, to bricked Homepods, to bad displays, your quality is definitely at an all-time low point.
IOS 13 is a disaster. Can anyone who has ever met Mr. Jobs when he was alive (I never had the pleasure unfortunately) imagine his response to bricking $300 Homepods and then having to replace them all at no cost?

I know you folks probably don‚Äôt read the other (I think they are called sub-reds) very much, but over on r/homekit, there are people who have bought 4 or so Homepods and had them all bricked by iOS 13.2. Over $900 in sales to a single person and you tanked them all. They are not happy and I have to say... I do not blame them one, damned bit.

I personally was going to post a short video which shows my Homekit Home app accessories blinking between ‚Äúunresponsive‚Äù , ‚Äúupdating‚Äù and ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù like some bad sci-fi space-movie set because of iPadOS 13 - but I did not want this letter to seem like simple venting or complaining. It is definitely not. Please understand that it is genuine concern.

I work at a large software company as a Scrum Master to four development teams. And if anything like iOS 13 was released by us, I think we all would be packing our bags. And while I love a good joke as much as the next person, may I very humbly suggest that you should spend a little less time getting Siri to sing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù to Mr. Cook, and a little more time on QA‚Äôing iOS 13 and cracking down on your hardware quality control?

I am an Apple devotee, and do not cherish the thought of having Windows 10 running my home automation. I simply can‚Äôt imagine what it would be like to have to answer the question ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù every time I want the fan in my bathroom to go on. Nor do I wish to give up my iPhone, iPad, Homepod or Macbook Pro. But unfortunately you are driving me to consider it. 

I know that I am just one person, and your daily sales figures will never miss me as a customer. But please know this... I have been an NFL fan my whole life and NEVER missed a game ( I am 60 now). Three years ago the players started kneeling during the National anthem. And while I fully support the right to protest, I have never watched a game since. Nether the players or the league commissioner apologized for accidentally insulting the brave men and women who protect our country. I know they did not mean to do so, but since they could not be bothered to apologize, I will not watch another game. I do not know who won the last two super bowls and do not care. To me, the NFL is dead. 

I believe there may be a few people like me who feel the same way about you folks. We are devotees, and would fully support and stand by Apple through this little bump in the road - but I think you need to do a little, honest admission. You have made a mistake, screwed up a bit and I think a sincere apology by Mr. Cook to the dedicated Apple user group may be in order. A simple apology goes a long, long way. 

In closing, I want to thank Apple for all of the years of quality and innovation. I truly hope and believe that you will be able to turn things around and get back on track. I just don‚Äôt think I will be a customer of yours when that happens.

I am a very concerned user, and while I have never shared a criticism of anyone or anything publicly (especially on social media channels), I have found myself forced into a position of doing so with you folks for the first time.

I have used Apple products since well before the days of your famous tag line ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù. Because... quite frankly ‚Äúit just did‚Äù. Microsoft, Google and others could be seen as only a far-away blur in your review mirror. Steve Jobs ran your company to perfection. And I believe everyone will have to admit, that although people may not have liked Mr. Jobs personally and he may have been tough to work for, during his tenure - Apple products ‚Äújust worked‚Äù. 

Now under Mr. Cook‚Äôs tenure, things have changed. While I believe the innovation is still alive and well at Apple, I believe your execution is nearly dead.

From bad keyboards, to bricked Homepods, to bad displays, your quality is definitely at an all-time low point.
IOS 13 is a disaster. Can anyone who has ever met Mr. Jobs when he was alive (I never had the pleasure unfortunately) imagine his response to bricking $300 Homepods and then having to replace them all at no cost?

I know you folks probably don‚Äôt read the other (I think they are called sub-reds) very much, but over on r/homekit, there are people who have bought 4 or so Homepods and had them all bricked by iOS 13.2. Over $900 in sales to a single person and you tanked them all. They are not happy and I have to say... I do not blame them one, damned bit.

I personally was going to post a short video which shows my Homekit Home app accessories blinking between ‚Äúunresponsive‚Äù , ‚Äúupdating‚Äù and ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù like some bad sci-fi space-movie set because of iPadOS 13 - but I did not want this letter to seem like simple venting or complaining. It is definitely not. Please understand that it is genuine concern.

I work at a large software company as a Scrum Master to four development teams. And if anything like iOS 13 was released by us, I think we all would be packing our bags. And while I love a good joke as much as the next person, may I very humbly suggest that you should spend a little less time getting Siri to sing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù to Mr. Cook, and a little more time on QA‚Äôing iOS 13 and cracking down on your hardware quality control?

I am an Apple devotee, and do not cherish the thought of having Windows 10 running my home automation. I simply can‚Äôt imagine what it would be like to have to answer the question ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù every time I want the fan in my bathroom to go on. Nor do I wish to give up my iPhone, iPad, Homepod or Macbook Pro. But unfortunately you are driving me to consider it. 

I know that I am just one person, and your daily sales figures will never miss me as a customer. But please know this... I have been an NFL fan my whole life and NEVER missed a game ( I am 60 now). Three years ago the players started kneeling during the National anthem. And while I fully support the right to protest, I have never watched a game since. Nether the players or the league commissioner apologized for accidentally insulting the brave men and women who protect our country. I know they did not mean to do so, but since they could not be bothered to apologize, I will not watch another game. I do not know who won the last two super bowls and do not care. To me, the NFL is dead. 

I believe there may be a few people like me who feel the same way about you folks. We are devotees, and would fully support and stand by Apple through this little bump in the road - but I think you need to do a little, honest admission. You have made a mistake, screwed up a bit and I think a sincere apology by Mr. Cook to the dedicated Apple user group may be in order. A simple apology goes a long, long way. 

In closing, I want to thank Apple for all of the years of quality and innovation. I truly hope and believe that you will be able to turn things around and get back on track. I just don‚Äôt think I will be a customer of yours when that happens.

Sound quality is really an extremely misunderstood subject on the internet today, audiophile snobs would have you believe a subjective sound quality scale like this:

Earpods: 1/10

Airpods: 2/10

Bose QC25:2/10

HiFiman Edition X: 9/10

Sennheiser Orpheus HEV9: 24/10

&#x200B;

However in reality, I would suggest it's more like this:

Earpods: 7/10

Airpods: 8/10

Bose QC25:8/10

HiFiman Edition X: 10/10

Sennheiser Orpheus HEV9: 10/10

Basically what I'm trying to say is, any decent headphone will be almost as good as the most ridiculously expensive Hi-Fi equipment, the difference is minimal, if any. Those audiophile gear are more like luxury watches, sure a luxury watch will be relative accurate, but even a $200 dollar mechanical watch can be just as accurate as a $200,000 mechanical watch.

**That being said, I'm happy to report that the AirPods Pro's sound quality is good enough that it makes no sense to split hairs, it basically sounds the same as the good headphones I own.** I'm not gonna give it a score or anything, I'll just say this, I currently own the Yamaha EPH-200, a fairly good IEM that has balanced sound, relatively flat response, and it sounds almost exactly the same as the AirPods Pro. I also have the AKG Q701, a classic, it sounds very slightly better and I'm not even sure if that's due to the sound or the fact it's around-ear and open. I also have the Beats Solo Wireless 3, it has more bass so the response isn't flat but other than that it again, sounds about the same as the bunch.

The biggest weakness with most cheaper (but still decent, not like Wish.com counterfeit crap) is bass, and that's because if you power the speaker with the same amount of power and have it make different sounds, it will naturally be weaker in the bass, so usually you need some way to get around that problem, which makes it more expensive. Also the solutions to these problems usually involve inefficiencies, like some IEMs will just put a filter in there to reduce the mids, and make everything louder. Or if you have a big headphone you can put some circuits in there to digitally change the sound so it comes out more balanced. This is why your standard EarPods and AirPods are a bit lacking in bass.

Basically that lack of bass problem is gone in AirPods Pro, so yea that's that.

&#x200B;

I will not address some of the audiophile snake oil you might see online, and first up is **sound stage.** If you don't know that is, well a headphone with ""good"" sound stage makes the music sound like it coming from in front of you, or maybe around you. Where as a headphone with ""bad"" sound stage makes it sound like the music is in your head. You'll constantly hear audiophile snobs talk about this and to be honest, it's a real thing. Problem is, it's just dumb to make a headphone have ""good"" sound stage.

You see, making a sound, sound like it came from further away is just like adding a filter to an image, like if you make a photo foggy then it looks like the things in it are further away, it's exactly like that, a post-process effect. Since most music are designed to be played back through speakers, they don't have and sound stage effect baked in, so if you just play them through theoretical ideal speakers in your ear, it sounds like the instruments are in your head. So what headphone manufacturers do, is they design their stuff in such a way as to physically introduce distortions that make it sound like it's from further away. This is really a hack, a dumb way to do things because that's like making your phone's display over-saturated to compensate for under-saturated dull movies like Justice league or something, it's dumb because when you want to watch a regular movie, then it would look like crap. Same with headphones with built-in sound stage otherwise known as ""good"" sound stage, if you're trying to watch some VR porn when the sound is supposed to come from right beside your ears or whatever, it won't work as well. And this is why Apple headphones just all have ""bad"" sound stage, since if you want it, it should be introduced in the software, not in the hardware.

&#x200B;

Second problem is how people misinterpret different frequency response curves as ""better"" or ""worse"" sound. Some headphones like Beats just has louder bass and highs with quieter mids, that's its style. If we're being technical, all of these styles are bad, because you're supposed to make the speaker have a totally flat response curve, that means every sound regardless of pitch should have exactly the same loudness. However this is extremely difficult to achieve with any sensible speaker technology, but what ended up happening, is that people have gotten used to the style of certain brands, and think that is ""good"" sound where as everything else is ""bad"" sound.

This is exactly like Instagram filters, making a headphone that has style is just like making a phone screen that has an Instagram filter burned into it which you cannot turn off, it's dumb but audiophile snobs love that shit. So when anyone tries to make actually close to ideal headphones, nobody buys them because they sound ""flat"" well of course they do, that's how they're supposed to work, flat is the best, because you can always make a ""flat"" headphone sound like anything else with your custom EQ, where as if it's not flat, it's more difficult to revert it with an EQ (but you still can do it).

Basically, whenever you hear an audiophile snob talk about things like mids, lows, highs, treble, extension, they all boil down to the frequency response curve, one graph that describes them all. It's just as senseless as describing a screen with words like ""the blues are very deep and slightly violet"", yea who gives a shit, just compare it to the standard and tell me what the Delta E is?

# Edit:

I believe there‚Äôs quirk with this thing, turning on ANC in some cases reduces bass, and this is most likely because the ANC is most effective for low frequency noise, so what happens is the drivers basically used up all of its bass output for ANC and there‚Äôs not much left. For best sound quality you still have to be in a quiet room with ANC off. Also I have to stress again, **forming a good seal is essential for correct bass response** with any kind of in-ear earbuds.

We have a bunch of audiophile snobs trying to put me down here, and you know what you're all welcome as long as you be specific as to what exactly are you disagreeing and why, and I'll reply to all of that. I will not reply to no-effort rants like ""you don't know anything"".

It's funny how when these guys reply they keep stressing the price, when that's just not very relevant for anything >$100:

The other issue is that the ear canal, especially if you get a tight seal, becomes essentially directly coupled to the driver. If you put flat frequency response straight into the ear canal, it sounds like the mediums and highs are way too loud, and so people come up with some kind of filtering process to approximate the realistic way sound behaves when it gets picked up by your earlobes and reflected/directed into your ear canal. It basically gets low-pass filtered according to the head dummy measurements, but there\'s also some comb filtering type action going from sound being inherently reflected from shoulders and from the earlobes themselves before it couples with the ear canal.\n\nWhat I\'m getting at is that there\'s necessarily an art about what is acceptable amount of sound processing just to make it sound flat and natural, which is all about how the sound is ""processed"" by the reflections that happen in real rooms, from your head shadow, shoulders, earlobes and what not, and yet the brain sorts that shit out right away and you aren\'t generally aware that it\'s happening, you just get impression of space the sound is in, and direction of the sound.

Sound quality is really an extremely misunderstood subject on the internet today, audiophile snobs would have you believe a subjective sound quality scale like this:

Earpods: 1/10

Airpods: 2/10

Bose QC25:2/10

HiFiman Edition X: 9/10

Sennheiser Orpheus HEV9: 24/10

&#x200B;

However in reality, I would suggest it's more like this:

Earpods: 7/10

Airpods: 8/10

Bose QC25:8/10

HiFiman Edition X: 10/10

Sennheiser Orpheus HEV9: 10/10

Basically what I'm trying to say is, any decent headphone will be almost as good as the most ridiculously expensive Hi-Fi equipment, the difference is minimal, if any. Those audiophile gear are more like luxury watches, sure a luxury watch will be relative accurate, but even a $200 dollar mechanical watch can be just as accurate as a $200,000 mechanical watch.

**That being said, I'm happy to report that the AirPods Pro's sound quality is good enough that it makes no sense to split hairs, it basically sounds the same as the good headphones I own.** I'm not gonna give it a score or anything, I'll just say this, I currently own the Yamaha EPH-200, a fairly good IEM that has balanced sound, relatively flat response, and it sounds almost exactly the same as the AirPods Pro. I also have the AKG Q701, a classic, it sounds very slightly better and I'm not even sure if that's due to the sound or the fact it's around-ear and open. I also have the Beats Solo Wireless 3, it has more bass so the response isn't flat but other than that it again, sounds about the same as the bunch.

The biggest weakness with most cheaper (but still decent, not like Wish.com counterfeit crap) is bass, and that's because if you power the speaker with the same amount of power and have it make different sounds, it will naturally be weaker in the bass, so usually you need some way to get around that problem, which makes it more expensive. Also the solutions to these problems usually involve inefficiencies, like some IEMs will just put a filter in there to reduce the mids, and make everything louder. Or if you have a big headphone you can put some circuits in there to digitally change the sound so it comes out more balanced. This is why your standard EarPods and AirPods are a bit lacking in bass.

Basically that lack of bass problem is gone in AirPods Pro, so yea that's that.

&#x200B;

I will not address some of the audiophile snake oil you might see online, and first up is **sound stage.** If you don't know that is, well a headphone with ""good"" sound stage makes the music sound like it coming from in front of you, or maybe around you. Where as a headphone with ""bad"" sound stage makes it sound like the music is in your head. You'll constantly hear audiophile snobs talk about this and to be honest, it's a real thing. Problem is, it's just dumb to make a headphone have ""good"" sound stage.

You see, making a sound, sound like it came from further away is just like adding a filter to an image, like if you make a photo foggy then it looks like the things in it are further away, it's exactly like that, a post-process effect. Since most music are designed to be played back through speakers, they don't have and sound stage effect baked in, so if you just play them through theoretical ideal speakers in your ear, it sounds like the instruments are in your head. So what headphone manufacturers do, is they design their stuff in such a way as to physically introduce distortions that make it sound like it's from further away. This is really a hack, a dumb way to do things because that's like making your phone's display over-saturated to compensate for under-saturated dull movies like Justice league or something, it's dumb because when you want to watch a regular movie, then it would look like crap. Same with headphones with built-in sound stage otherwise known as ""good"" sound stage, if you're trying to watch some VR porn when the sound is supposed to come from right beside your ears or whatever, it won't work as well. And this is why Apple headphones just all have ""bad"" sound stage, since if you want it, it should be introduced in the software, not in the hardware.

&#x200B;

Second problem is how people misinterpret different frequency response curves as ""better"" or ""worse"" sound. Some headphones like Beats just has louder bass and highs with quieter mids, that's its style. If we're being technical, all of these styles are bad, because you're supposed to make the speaker have a totally flat response curve, that means every sound regardless of pitch should have exactly the same loudness. However this is extremely difficult to achieve with any sensible speaker technology, but what ended up happening, is that people have gotten used to the style of certain brands, and think that is ""good"" sound where as everything else is ""bad"" sound.

This is exactly like Instagram filters, making a headphone that has style is just like making a phone screen that has an Instagram filter burned into it which you cannot turn off, it's dumb but audiophile snobs love that shit. So when anyone tries to make actually close to ideal headphones, nobody buys them because they sound ""flat"" well of course they do, that's how they're supposed to work, flat is the best, because you can always make a ""flat"" headphone sound like anything else with your custom EQ, where as if it's not flat, it's more difficult to revert it with an EQ (but you still can do it).

Basically, whenever you hear an audiophile snob talk about things like mids, lows, highs, treble, extension, they all boil down to the frequency response curve, one graph that describes them all. It's just as senseless as describing a screen with words like ""the blues are very deep and slightly violet"", yea who gives a shit, just compare it to the standard and tell me what the Delta E is?

# Edit:

I believe there‚Äôs quirk with this thing, turning on ANC in some cases reduces bass, and this is most likely because the ANC is most effective for low frequency noise, so what happens is the drivers basically used up all of its bass output for ANC and there‚Äôs not much left. For best sound quality you still have to be in a quiet room with ANC off. Also I have to stress again, **forming a good seal is essential for correct bass response** with any kind of in-ear earbuds.

We have a bunch of audiophile snobs trying to put me down here, and you know what you're all welcome as long as you be specific as to what exactly are you disagreeing and why, and I'll reply to all of that. I will not reply to no-effort rants like ""you don't know anything"".

It's funny how when these guys reply they keep stressing the price, when that's just not very relevant for anything >$100:

I have been becoming concerned over the level at which I've been having to raise the Airpods up to, especially while at the gym. I picked up the Pros today after work and immediately put them to the test. My gym is relatively small, and tonight was rather busy with probably 30-40ish people there give or take. 

\- I've never liked in ear headphones, or have been able to wear them. They always fall out or give me that strange pressure in my head. I felt that the OG airpods were a perfect fit, which is why I was slightly hesitant on the Pros. After an initial adjustment period, that ""in ear"" feeling went away, and I was left with that same comfortable and secure feeling the OGs have. Only at the beginning did I feel like they had a chance of falling out, but that went away quickly as I ran on the treadmill.

\- In terms of sound quality, I am no audiophile. I will say it sounds pretty on par with my second gen Airpods. I'm not sure if the quality has improved or I can just hear it clearer with the NC on. If you were happy with the other Airpods, you'll be perfectly happy with these as well IMO. 

\- I opted for the small tips as they felt the most comfortable and best fit for my ears. 

\- There is something very magical about the first time I put them in. In terms of how noise cancellation works - if you're looking for a product to 100% drown out any background noise - you'll be disappointed with these. My best way to describe them is that it puts the rest of the world on ""low mode"", if that makes any sense. I could still hear the clangs of weights as they were moving around, but the humming of the air conditioners, people's conversations and the music in the gym faded away. It drowns out  the world enough that with your music playing, you kind of forget about everything else around you. 

\- I was playing my music at around 55-60% with noise cancellation on, where as normally my other Airpods would have to be about 75-80%. I switched the noise cancellation off in the middle of the workout to see how it felt without it - It's like night and day. Hard to believe I was blasting my other Airpods at such a high level for so long. 

\- I put on a podcast to test, I had to knock the volume up one notch to comfortably hear it. But could still easily listen to it around 50-55% if I wanted. 

\- At the end of my workout when I took them out I realized just how loud the gym was. There was a Zumba class in the room over that sounded like it could double for a night club. With the Pros in I didn't even realize the class had started. 

Overall if you're happy with your current Airpods or other NC headphones, I'm not sure these will revolutionize your listening experience. But if you're looking for the simplicity of Airpods mixed with a very solid noise cancellation feature, I think you'll be more than happy.

Overall the AirPod Pros are much more comfortable than the Sonys, mostly due to the air vent and lighter weight. It was amazing to hear active noise cancelling without the air pressure seal - it felt like the world just got much quieter instead of the extremely isolating feeling of the Sonys. In some situations (bus driving by on the street, very loud subway noise) the isolation was better in the Sonys but I was shocked how closely the AirPod Pros come.  In day to day situations (sitting at a desk) they are much better because of the comfort. The passthrough mode also works very well, I could easily hear anyone talking to me (to the level where it was not awkward in a coffee shop - whereas with the Sonys the passthrough wasn't quite good enough to hold a conversation).

&#x200B;

Overall I am very impressed with the noise cancelling in these. They took out fan noise so well that I think they might be quite effective on an airplane. They take out the rest of the spectrum a little bit less than the WF-1000xm3s, which I think is mostly due to physical isolation.

&#x200B;

The real reason I am going to keep these is the case! The size is **so** much more practical than the Sonys, it's ridiculous. They are so much more comfortable carrying around and using walking around a city.

EDIT: In my opinion the sound quality is much less good than the WF1000XM3. The sony buds have crisp sound where every part of a track is clear and punchy. The airpods, not so much. They sound fine, especially for podcasts and audiobooks (which is by far the bulk of my listening)!

If the sound can hit the front/back of your ear, it'll make it's way into your ear canal.\n\nIf you're looking for earbuds, ANC will greatly improve the experience. If you're specifically looking for ANC, you'll want over the ear headphones."", ""I don't think the average person understands how noise cancellation works (that's not a dig at you).\n\nNoise Cancelling headphones are sort of a scam - they can't cancel out cars honking, or people talking or babies crying or basically anything that is a combination of noises. They can only cancel out a single ambient noise ie airplane engine, maybe when you're inside a train, lawn mower, basically any constant ambient noise.\n\nIt's far better to focus on headphones that provide really good Noise Isolation like over hear headphones with a D cup for a better seal around your ear or earbuds with rubber tips (one reason why AirPods Pro have rubber tips otherwise the noise cancelation would be useless).\n\nThere will be people that say their Bose headphones or some other brand cancel all that stuff out - but that has more to do with having a really good seal on/in your ear than the actual ANC.\n\nAt best ANC headphones can diminish the intensity of certain sounds, but as far as 'Canceling' out noise, that's gonna be left to only hums, airplane engines and other ambient noises. People buying AirPods Pro for noise cancelation thinking their loud office or walk in downtown NYC will be eliminated are going to completely underwhlemed - and not with just AirPods Pro, that goes for any ANC headphone."", ""Damn, I bought a pair specifically to try out on a flight this weekend.

If you want to save money get them refurb or used, as long as they work it doesn‚Äôt matter. When you fly, wear them over your 535s (not connected to anything, just for the noise canceling). \n\nIf you do that, no one on the plane will be in as quiet of a place as you. Someone could be talking next to you. You wouldn‚Äôt know if. A baby could be crying. You wouldn‚Äôt know it. An engine could surge fail and fall off and as long as it doesn‚Äôt shake the damn plane you still wouldn‚Äôt know it. \n\nI know this because I had a pair of 535s at one point and did this.

You could listen to music on the lowest possible volume setting or second lowest (depending on how it was recorded) and still hear it perfectly clearly on take off.\n\nI do this right now with my IEMs (Etymotic but they seal like Shure) and it‚Äôs what I would do in your place. If you have them, I‚Äôd keep the regular air pods for the city and other situations where you don‚Äôt want the isolation.

Initial impressions in simple, practical terms:

* Pairing w/iPhone 11 was simple & identical to Airpods
* Ear test is easily completed within three seconds and a nice touch
* Pushing on the stem w/two fingers for about one second toggles between active noise cancellation, transparency mode
* Quickly pushing on the stem *once* toggles between play & pause, *twice* for next track, and *thrice* for previous track
* Sound quality is subjective, but in my opinion is only *slightly* better than Airpods due to the seal formed. Tested w/a few bass-heavy tracks and they get the job done but are nothing extraordinary. OTOH, Jabra 65t's have noticeably better sound quality than the Airpods Pro
* Call quality was on par w/Airpods
* Out-the-box the left pod had 85% battery, right had 54%, and the case was at 50%
* I have not had an opportunity to *truly* test the ANC but in a controlled environment it felt fine. However, as a frequent flier, I doubt their ability to knock out as much ambient noise as my QC 35's

These observations took me literally no more than twenty minutes. It is possible in practical use my thoughts will change over longer usage throughout the day. 

**Update**: I left for work, walking to the train station, and am currently riding on public transport in Tokyo. Here are some more quick thoughts:

* Standard fishbowl sound when wearing in-ear is not present in transparency mode. This was not immediately noticeable until I walked out and was locking my door. With ANC on there is only a slight fishbowly sound 
* ANC was immediately noticeable as I walked outside. It is very good at removing traffic noise and other average noise you hear when walking outside
* Transparency mode is great for getting a good sense of what noises are around you while walking around. Turning ANC off completely does the same whereas transparency mode seems to add some amplification, although exactly what it is I could be wrong
* While waiting at a train crossing, with the standard warning noises of an incoming train quite loud, ANC completely removed all of the sounds 
* On the train itself, all standard noise is completely blocked by ANC. If you have to rely on the train operator to announce your stop, best bet is to use transparency mode or turn ANC completely off
* No additional noticeable difference in sound quality throughout a variety of musical genres

I will do my best to quickly address any questions anyone may have.

**Update 2**: After coming back home from work I tested the AirPods Pro against the Jabra Elite Active 65t's. I put together a semi-random playlist that would, hopefully, highlight the bass, mids, and highs of each set and give me a better indication of the sound quality of the newer AirPods Pro.

For anyone interested, here is the playlist I used:

* Blackmill - The Drift
* Travis King - Beautiful Mind
* Jack White - Love is Blindness
* Disturbed - The Sound of Silence
* Dash Berlin - Coming Home
* Armin van Buuren vs Shapov - The Last Dancer
* Metallica - The Unforgiven
* Armin van Buuren - Wild Wild Son
* Edge of Infinity - Crop

When testing the AirPods Pro I *enabled* ANC, and for the 65t's I *disabled* passthrough. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison but as close as you can get.

After this testing, and using them for a considerable amount of time today during public transportation commuting and at work, I actually have to reconsider my *initial thoughts* on the AirPods Pro sound quality. I found them to sound considerably better than the OG AirPods, and even better on the mids and highs than the 65t's. The 65t's do have more prominent bass, but from an overall sound quality perspective the AirPods Pro outshined the 65t's. Add on the better overall tech and I feel like the AirPods Pro are a winner.

I have Airpods for a few years and have been using the Sony  WF1000XM3 for a couple of months now. \n\n* Both have a great seal to my ears but i feel like Airpods pro just fits a little bit better to my ears.\n* Airpods pro sound better than Airpods, but XM3 still sounds better IMO; XM3 have a bit richer and fuller sound to my ears. Bass is noticeably richer on XM3 and there is an app on the phone you can change it depending on your liking. So i'd say XM3 gives you more control on how you want them to sound like than the Airpods pro.  \n* ANC is great on both. They block out most street noises but if nothing is playing you can still hear a bit of the noise. \n* The charging case and the earbuds physical size are noticeably smaller on the Airpods pro which to me is quite impressive given what they are capable of.  Airpods pro case is both shorter and narrower than the XM3 case. When worn on ear, Airpods pro do not stick out horizontally as much as the XM3 and i personally prefer the on-ear look of the Airpods pro than the XM3 because of that. \n* Nevertheless, the Sonys' battery lasts longer (6hrs vs 4.5hrs) \n*  The XM3 connection do drop out once in a while in busy streets and densely populated areas.

Initial impressions in simple, practical terms:

* Pairing w/iPhone 11 was simple & identical to Airpods
* Ear test is easily completed within three seconds and a nice touch
* Pushing on the stem w/two fingers for about one second toggles between active noise cancellation, transparency mode
* Quickly pushing on the stem *once* toggles between play & pause, *twice* for next track, and *thrice* for previous track
* Sound quality is subjective, but in my opinion is only *slightly* better than Airpods due to the seal formed. Tested w/a few bass-heavy tracks and they get the job done but are nothing extraordinary. OTOH, Jabra 65t's have noticeably better sound quality than the Airpods Pro
* Call quality was on par w/Airpods
* Out-the-box the left pod had 85% battery, right had 54%, and the case was at 50%
* I have not had an opportunity to *truly* test the ANC but in a controlled environment it felt fine. However, as a frequent flier, I doubt their ability to knock out as much ambient noise as my QC 35's

These observations took me literally no more than twenty minutes. It is possible in practical use my thoughts will change over longer usage throughout the day. 

**Update**: I left for work, walking to the train station, and am currently riding on public transport in Tokyo. Here are some more quick thoughts:

* Standard fishbowl sound when wearing in-ear is not present in transparency mode. This was not immediately noticeable until I walked out and was locking my door. With ANC on there is only a slight fishbowly sound 
* ANC was immediately noticeable as I walked outside. It is very good at removing traffic noise and other average noise you hear when walking outside
* Transparency mode is great for getting a good sense of what noises are around you while walking around. Turning ANC off completely does the same whereas transparency mode seems to add some amplification, although exactly what it is I could be wrong
* While waiting at a train crossing, with the standard warning noises of an incoming train quite loud, ANC completely removed all of the sounds 
* On the train itself, all standard noise is completely blocked by ANC. If you have to rely on the train operator to announce your stop, best bet is to use transparency mode or turn ANC completely off
* No additional noticeable difference in sound quality throughout a variety of musical genres

I will do my best to quickly address any questions anyone may have.

**Update 2**: After coming back home from work I tested the AirPods Pro against the Jabra Elite Active 65t's. I put together a semi-random playlist that would, hopefully, highlight the bass, mids, and highs of each set and give me a better indication of the sound quality of the newer AirPods Pro.

1. The ear pieces snap onto the AirPods which makes it both scary to remove (you have to pull hard) but also legitimizes the cost of replacement that Apple has listed. They also won't fall off like many third party options!
2. The sound check should be performed with the smallest pieces attached first if that is what you are used to. Both small and medium tips worked for me during the sound check, but I always prefer smaller. Don't assume that a positive check with medium tips means small won't work.

Even as a front-line programmer you will only be stellar by being a leader with these traits at your own level in the organization - you lead on coding, architecture and enthusiasm.  This also feeds into #3 - you will be that ""great person to work with"" which tends to attract having great people to work with.  Being the asshole and the obstruction is the best way to assure failure.\n\nGreat advice Craig!', '""go broad and deep.""   \n\n\nLMAO.

It was not until I manually selected the units of measure in the settings that these began to behave correctly. Consider using GPS to set these to a default locale on first launch. \n\nIn the United States, inches of mercury (in Hg) is a/the common measurement for air pressure, whereas setting United States shows pressure in millibars. \n\nFor me personally, I would prefer if the hourly display of temperature/precipitation chance/etc was scrollable left to right instead of paginated. It was not immediately obvious as to where to tap to get to the second page of the hourly data. \n\nWhen pulling down to refresh data multiple times in quick succession you get multiple stacking reloading icons that just keeps adding dead space to the top of the app until you force close it. \n\nConsider adding padding to the bottom of the forecast page so when you scroll to the bottom of the app ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù sits nicely near the top of the page. \n\nWhen tapping to expand and collapse the daily forecast the text immediately appears before the space has a chance to expand, and on collapse the text does not disappear until after the space is collapsed, leading to text to be superimposed on top of each other for quite a few frames until the animation completes. \n\nIf you choose a default hourly condition in settings, if you don‚Äôt move the selector and just click done, it becomes blank until you leave the settings page and re-enter it. Same with the data source selector. \n\nWhen browsing to the settings page for the first time, all of the units of measurement selections were selected with a blue check mark, it was not immediately obvious that I needed to tap one to actually select it. \n\nI did not test anything related to the pro features as I don‚Äôt have pro.', 'Kinda looks like dark sky?', 'I love Cumulus.

So here I am. I don‚Äôt want to sound entitled, but I know I do when I say that Apple should never have shipped anything less functional than 12.4. Don‚Äôt make updating your phone to new software *feel like a mistake*, Apple! Fucking release features *when they are ready*, not rushed to meet some deadline that you yourself created!

This next year will be make or break for me. I‚Äôm all-in on Apple‚Äôs stance on privacy and usability, but they need to start living up to those expectations. 

And yeah, yeah, I know, but *make a fucking smaller phone next year*. Ordinarily, I‚Äôd say the market would handle this, but it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs really anywhere else to go.

Here‚Äôs to hoping iOS 13.2 brings some changes. üçª

Out of the blue, my AirPods stopped working. The Bluetooth connects, I hear the bing, and it shows the symbol. But no sounds comes out of them, whether it‚Äôs YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, or Podcasts. But if I sync my AirPods up to my computer or to my friend‚Äôs phone, they play sound just fine. To make matters even more perplexing, when I connect my friend‚Äôs AirPods to my phone, they work fine. So the only obstacle is when I connect my phone to my AirPods. It connects successfully, but plays no sound. I‚Äôve charged both devices, restarted them (and reset the AirPods), reconnected them, checked the max volume, audio balance, etc etc. I‚Äôve tried all the usual tricks. What isn‚Äôt google telling me? Are there any options short of swapping AirPods with my friend?', 'I have an IPhone XS Max and recently updated to iOS 13 and my battery has been draining while only being off in my pocket. I checked the [battery app](https://imgur.com/a/LA99W9J)  and it said mail was using the most battery while only on in the background and I don‚Äôt even use the mail app nor have any e-mail connected to it.

Help??"", ""**MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)**\n\nMy computer recently needed repair for a dead battery but also a few other issues (something about a bad cable and the whole top half/display needed to be replaced, I think). Thankfully I had apple care and they did all this for free. But still, I'm wondering why this would have happened on a 2018 macbook air that I've owned for little more than 10 months. Basically my computer would drop by 1% every 5-10 seconds and then it would totally shut down/die once it hit a certain percentage (originally started around 30% but then kept going up until it would start dying at 90% and then it got to the point where it stopped turning on at all). I think the dying issue was a separate issue due to some damage it received, however I'm worrying there could be something about my use patterns that at least caused the poor battery life and so I'm wondering how to avoid that in the future. I used to have the display set to never turn off and so my computer would typically be on all day (with tons of chrome tabs) and I'd just close the screen at night. Once the battery issues became apparent I think I usually kept it plugged in all the time, but before that I would more often let it fully discharge before fully recharging and repeating. Is there anything about that kind of usage that would have caused the battery to die so quickly or did I just get a dud?"", ""Sidecar & VPN:  \n\n\nI found out this week that my VPN doesn't allow for split tunnel, which means I can't use VPN and Sidecar at the same time.

I spilled a full cup (like 10 oz) of coffee on it on Monday. Before I was able to process what I did and turn it off, it shut down on its own. I figured that it was fried. The nearest Apple store near me didn't have availability for a few days so I took it to a nearby mom and pop computer repair shop. They were able to disassemble it and clean out and dry the insides of it, but told me that it needed a new logic board and fan and that they were able to turn it on, but it would overheat and shut down on its own. Given that it's a 4.5 year old computer, I figured that it didn't make sense to sink more money into it and that I'd just get a new one for Black Friday.\n\nI took it home and wanted to try and format the hard drive so that I could sell it for parts. With nothing to lose at this point, I placed it on top of four ice packs to keep it cool and started playing around with it. I wasn't able to boot into Mac OS, but was able to boot into Recovery. Most of all, I was able to reinstall Mac OS and crazy enough, the computer runs without any issues even without those ice packs. The battery is absolutely shot, but everything else works perfectly fine. The only issue is with heat - it does get hotter than it used to (although not too hot, averages in the low 80s Celsius) and I frequently hear the fan spin up.\n\nI left it on overnight to download items I had backed up in the cloud and it did this all without issue. At this point, I'm considering just taking it into an Apple store to get a new battery and continuing to use it as is for the foreseeable future.\n\nMy question is - what are the chances it will fail in the future? I'm sure that the coffee spill did do some damage to components other than the battery, but so far, everything works fine. Can the Apple Store run a test to see if any other components are affected? I am worried about the fan/heating issue, as I know that heat can kill electronic components, but at this point all I see is that the fan is spinning up more than it used to and this thing just keeps chugging along."", 'Are the iPhone servers down or slow?

If you compare the original Apple Watch to the original iPhone or iPod or iPad, the AW tried to do so much more, but so much of what it was doing just wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòright‚Äô. The honeycomb screen. The friends button. Glances. The underuse of the Crown. Various app switching behaviors. Those creepy 3D emoji. The difficulty in switching watch faces. General UI navigation. An app ecosystem that was useless because of how slow it was. The list goes on. \n\nAnother example is tvOS and its App Store. Another example is the iPhone X‚Äôs new app switcher, where you couldn‚Äôt swipe up to close. Another example is Apple Music and its UI. You get the idea. \n\nIn most cases, Apple improves and corrects these UI problems over time, but that‚Äôs fundamentally different from how Apple operated under Steve. \n\nBack then, a new product would have 5 features and Apple would nail all 5 of those features. Apple would nail the fundamental user experience and the purpose of the product. Then, over time, it would add more features and make everything more technically impressive.

Before I was able to process what I did and turn it off, it shut down on its own. I figured that it was fried. The nearest Apple store near me didn't have availability for a few days so I took it to a nearby mom and pop computer repair shop. They were able to disassemble it and clean out and dry the insides of it, but told me that it needed a new logic board and fan and that they were able to turn it on, but it would overheat and shut down on its own. Given that it's a 4.5 year old computer, I figured that it didn't make sense to sink more money into it and that I'd just get a new one for Black Friday.\n\nI took it home and wanted to try and format the hard drive so that I could sell it for parts. With nothing to lose at this point, I placed it on top of four ice packs to keep it cool and started playing around with it. I wasn't able to boot into Mac OS, but was able to boot into Recovery. Most of all, I was able to reinstall Mac OS and crazy enough, the computer runs without any issues even without those ice packs. The battery is absolutely shot, but everything else works perfectly fine. The only issue is with heat - it does get hotter than it used to (although not too hot, averages in the low 80s Celsius) and I frequently hear the fan spin up.\n\nI left it on overnight to download items I had backed up in the cloud and it did this all without issue. At this point, I'm considering just taking it into an Apple store to get a new battery and continuing to use it as is for the foreseeable future.\n\nMy question is - what are the chances it will fail in the future? I'm sure that the coffee spill did do some damage to components other than the battery, but so far, everything works fine. Can the Apple Store run a test to see if any other components are affected? I am worried about the fan/heating issue, as I know that heat can kill electronic components, but at this point all I see is that the fan is spinning up more than it used to and this thing just keeps chugging along."", 'That was an awesome idea!

What we are going through right now is an extended beta and all of this is pretend. Because marketing says it\'s shipping code doesn\'t mean it\'s shipping code as we have seen. 13.1 beta being out before 13.0 arrives means it is all a work in progress. There are still major things wrong that the next patch won\'t release.\n\nBy the time all this settles down and it is robust we will be six months into the lifespan of iOS 13. This means that feature development now has six months for the next cycle if they stay on a one year cycle and all that is going to do is become a feedback loop of more rushed production, more cut corners, more held back features, and more sloppy deliveries that marketing pretends are the finals.\n\nThe alternative is to go to a pure even/odd delivery where even numbered OS\'s are simply polishing and refinement and performance adjusting of the odd number that came before.\n\nThis will let them do a 2 year release cycle in reality for an iOS that will look like this:\n\n1. fake delivery on September of the odd numbered iOS\n2. six months of frantic patching and releasing and fixing major bugs\n3. six months of calm chasing down and extinguishing of minor and annoying bugs\n4. in September, release the even numbered iOS which is basically a thoroughly debugged and fixed release of the previous odd number release\n5. begin feature development for the next odd numbered release and have a year to do so\n\nThis is reality. They can\'t keep doing this stuff and having marketing tell them what the release dates are or they need to scale down a lot of what they want to deliver on an annual basis which marketing will not like one bit.\n\nFor me what it also does is pulls the pants down on Swift because they made all these claims that ""oh a baby can program and make apps with Swift!"" and that Swift was going to solve all these development problems. \n\nAfter Swift we have the two worst releases for day one quality iOS in 11 and 13. \n\nYou can program this whole thing in assembly language if you follow the right processes. If you have bad processes you have the most restrictive handholding language and you will still make shit.\n\nWhich is what they are making, because they have a culture problem.\n\niOS12 was so good because it was a forced acceptance of the reality of the 18 month schedule I described above. iOS 14 hopefully will be the same thing.\n\nA a developer, iOS13 has been a nightmare because the bugs are pervasive and forced me to develop about two months of code which is all prefixed with _ios13patchfix_ on my methods. So if they ever fix the underlying problems I can identify all my workarounds and trim them out. But I will have lost two months this year just working around shit that they broke and served up to me: if you want to release on iOS 13 you need to deal with this. Things that worked perfectly fine for 7 years suddenly stopped working. That should never happen. \n\nThat reddit video where the boys are going around at school and kicking the back of the knees of the girls standing in groups, that\'s basically how it feels to be a developer with iOS 13.', ""You know, the folks at Apple get paid a heck of a lot more than I do and I'm sure they know better, and I'm also sure that this guy's take oversimplifies the situation to some degree, but how on God's green earth is it an acceptable policy to willfully allow your products to stagnate with old bugs that are intentionally never fixed because last year's release was also broken?  Broke is still broke."", 'Unpopular opinion here... but I truly don‚Äôt think things are really as bad as people like the make it seem. \n\nI‚Äôve been an Apple user for decades, and I can recall OS X releases where FileVault failed and I lost a ton of data, where constant kernel panics were a normal thing, and MobileMe just flat out deleted everything I had. \n\nThere do seem to be a few highly visible bugs that come up with every major macOS release, that eventually get ironed out. It‚Äôs the same cycle every year. But overall these releases are generally free of major bugs like was normal in the past, and usually ship with bugs that are minor inconvenience. This has been my experience. \n\nIt seems like people are less forgiving of the fact that this is complex software dealing with many moving pieces, and overall doing some really amazing stuff. And instead just want to focus on whatever doesn‚Äôt work, no matter the severity. But that‚Äôs just my impression.', 'hat doesn\'t make sense. None of this has changed from previous updates and all previous macOS updates were far more stable than this one. This isn\'t a particularly feature laden update either.\nBut now all of a sudden we get catastrophic (deleted emails) and less catastrophic (missing Music playlists) data loss, crash bugs and generally weird behaviour of many apps.\n\nI have identified one particular area where bugs are endemic: iCloud and it\'s complete failure to deal with multiple OS and client app versions. This is clearly a design issue as it also manifests itself in many ways that are not bugs as such.\n\nFor instance, Notes has gained the ability to share folders via iCloud. But if you create a folder and then share it from a device with the latest OS version, that folder disappears from all devices running older OS versions and importantly also from the icloud.com website.\n\nReminders on Catalina warns you of such version incompatibilities and the wording is telling. It\'s talking about ""converting"" something to the latest version. ""Conversion"" shouldn\'t even be a thing that users need to know about where no user controlled files are involved.\n\nAll indications are that there is a fundamental design error at the very core of iCloud\'s architecture. It feels like iCloud operates not as a single source of truth but as yet another device that participates in peer to peer syncing. This is a very complex architecture and they haven\'t been able to make it work.\n\nSo my conclusion is that iCloud which has always been exceptionally buggy has become pervasive within Apple\'s ecosystem. This is what has changed', ""I can't be the only one who hasn't experienced any bugs on my devices right? I can't even remember the last time I encountered a bug while using my iPhone.

Yes, many bug reports will be bogus, but many will be pure gold (I speak from experience). Yes, it involves a lot of manual work. But it is so incredibly worth it ‚Äî you get to catch the odd bugs that you will never catch with automated or in-house testing.\nIn contrast, big companies like Apple try very hard to avoid and ignore user bug reports. There is no way to easily E-mail them, ""filing a radar"" is hard, and even if you do they do their best to ignore your report.\n\nWhen I wrote ""percentage of revenue"", I meant it. In my software business (https://partsbox.io/), I dedicate about 10% of my time to reading, analyzing, and responding to user bug reports. Carefully thinking about every report let me catch bugs and problems that I never would have found. I also learned that every user bug report carries some information: even if something isn\'t actually a bug, getting multiple reports about it might point to a usability or a documentation problem.\n\nIf Apple also spent 10% of its revenue on processing bug reports and fixing bugs, they would not have a quality problem like they do now.', 'Got some weird bug on my laptop since Catalina where I have to click like 10 times instead of double clicking in Finder.

Death by a thousand cuts, as the Chinese say. It‚Äôs a Faustian bargain, really. And few multinational companies are going to choose ethics over profit, especially if it will imperil the business. And in the process, they indirectly aid in the real oppression of people. \n\nI am beginning to think that the Marxists are right when they say that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism.

In the real world, China has not only the ability to damage Taiwan economically; they‚Äôve promised to invade if there is any declaration  of independence. \n\nWould it be morally justified to declare independence? Absolutely. But would taking that stand be worth the human toll, which doesn‚Äôt just include the destruction of Taiwan, but the risk of no less than a World War with nukes if the US gets involved? (Which, by treaty, they are bound to come to Taiwan‚Äôs defense?) So many people in Taiwan prefer and want to preserve the status quo. It seems the least disruptive and safest route for now.

I\'m sure there are some things OpenDoc does, probably even more that I\'m not familiar with, that nothing else out there does. And I\'m sure that you can make some demos, maybe a small commercial app, that demonstrates those things. The hardest thing is, how does that fit into a cohesive larger vision that\'s gonna allow you to sell 8 billion dollars - 10 billion dollars of product a year?\n\nOne of the things I\'ve always found is that you\'ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can\'t start with the technology and try to figure out where you\'re going to try to sell it. I\'ve made this mistake probably more than anybody else in this room, and I\'ve got the scar tissue to prove it. And I know that it\'s the case. As we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple, it started with ""What incredible benefits can we give to the customer? Where can we take the customer?"" not starting with, ""Let\'s sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how are we going to market that. And I think that\'s the right path to take.\n\nI remember, with the LaswerWriter - we built the world\'s first laser printer, as you know, and there was awesome technology in that box. We had the first Canon cheap laser printing engine in the United States. We had a very wonderful printer controller, we had Adobe\'s PostScript software in there, we had AppleTalk in there, just awesome technology in the box. And I remember seeing the first print-out come out of it. Just picking it up and looking at it, and thinking, ""You know, we can sell this."" Because you don\'t need to know anything about what\'s in that box. All we have to do is hold it up and go, ""do you want this?"" And if you can remember back to 1984 before laser printers, it was pretty startling to see that. People went, ""Whoah. Yes.""\n\nThat\'s where Apple\'s gotta get back to. I\'m sorry that OpenDoc is a casualty along the way, and I readily admit there\'s many things in life that I don\'t have the faintest idea what I\'m talking about. So I apologize for that too. But there\'s a whole lot of people working super, super hard right now at Apple. You know - Avie, John, Guerrino, Fred, I mean the whole team is working - burning the midnight oil, and hundreds of people below them - to execute on some of these things, and they\'re doing their best.\n\nAnd some mistakes will be made along the way, by the way. That\'s good. Because at least some decisions are being made. We\'ll find the mistakes, and we\'ll fix \'em. And I think what we need to do is support that team. Going through this stage, as they work their butts off - they\'re all getting calls to go do this, do that, the valley\'s hot - none of them are leaving. And I think we need to support them, and see them through this, and write some damn good applications out in the market.\n\nMistakes will be made, some people will be pissed off, some people will not know what they\'re talking about, but I think it\'s so much better than where things were not very long ago.

I've been holding onto this story for a long while now. I've told friends and family about this, and a few coworkers knew about this as well. I've never seen it posted anywhere before, so I figured this would be a good place to share the story. I'm fairly positive this was handled 100% silently and internally by Apple and their temp agency Volt. I don't think there's any reason not to share this publicly, so here it is.

A long time ago, during the iPhone 4 and 4s era, myself and other recent computer science graduates from college took 'Technician' jobs at Apple in Elk Grove, CA, doing repair work on iPhones and iPads. That's what we were *told* it would be anyways; as it turned out it was mainly just 'diagnostic' work, and the 'diagnostics' were tapping the screen to make sure various features were working.

This was a painfully boring job, and the tests were so poorly designed that we ended up failing probably close to a thousand iPads for wifi problems that actually had no wifi problems at all. There were many other issues with the tests that, to this day, still has me wondering how they managed to be implemented... but that's not what this story is about. I digress.

The work was divided into stations. The first couple stations would grab the iPhones (or iPads in the iPad line) that came in and factory reset them using iTunes, each station using about 8 computers simultaneously for higher throughput. The rest of the stations down the line would take each phone and test it for a specific function to make sure it was working. Phone calls, speakerphone, wifi, screen issues, etc.

The work was performed in a warehouse that was fenced in with metal detectors and security all over the entrances. At the time, you were allowed to bring in your phones. If you had an iPhone, you had to register the serial number with security. They would give you a laminated print out with your name and the serial number, and when walking through security you had to show them the print out as well as the serial number on your actual phone. You also had to move the screen around so they could verify it wasn't just a picture of the serial number that you put on the phone.

Attempted theft was surprisingly common. I recall at least a few people that were caught attempting to sneak out iPhones. The most notable of which was the man who put a few phones into his pockets, walked through the metal detector after his shift, and when it went off he dashed for the door in a full blown sprint. Hilariously, *this guy was huge and didn't run very fast at all*, and security got to him *within seconds*.

Successful theft also happened. One of my colleagues later admitted to me (after my employment was long over) that he got an iPhone out on his last day of employment by wearing a giant belt buckle and took an iPhone to the bathroom (located inside the secured area) and taped the iPhone to his skin directly underneath the buckle. When metal detectors went off, security would pull out those metal detector wands and scan you down, and if you showed them your belt buckle was setting it off they'd just let you walk through after the rest of your body was scanned. I always wondered if he prepped the night before making sure he was very smoothly shaven so he wouldn't rip out hairs when removing the phone (lol).

Now to the main point of the story: one newer technician who we'll call Dave, about a few months into his 12 month contract, came up with a very creative way to get iPhones out of the building. During this time, none of us knew what was going on, all we knew was that Dave had a station that he really liked working at; the receiving station. For most of us it was the worst station to work at because your speed set the pace for the rest of the line, and it never had any downtime. We almost always just let him have that station. Even when stations were rotated or assigned by management, he usually managed to hang on to that one by talking his way into it.

As time went on, some of us started realizing that Dave had 2 iPhones he would bring with him in to work, and then take out back through security every day. One of us asked him about it and he said he had a personal phone and a second phone for a side business he was running. A satisfactory answer for us; nobody asked him about it again.

More months passed, and I got a job offer at another company for a 'real' IT position, and several of the techs hired with me were at the end of their 12 month contract, so there was a sudden rotation in people. A couple weeks after my employment ended, I got a call from one of my former colleagues about Dave. Apparently, one of the new techs was inspecting Dave's work really closely, and noticed that Dave was rooting (jailbreaking) some of the iPhones he was working on, and changing the serial numbers to match the serial numbers on his laminated print outs.

Dave would simply walk out to his car with 2 iPhones during lunch, drop them off at his car, walk back in empty handed, and walk back out at the end of the day with 2 more iPhones.

The tech reported him to management and he was arrested. Apple was quiet about the numbers and details, but those of us who worked that specific line who had been at Apple for a while could put 2 and 2 together, and we knew exactly how long this was going on. Figuring that Dave would have easily been able to steal 4 iPhones a day most days, 5 days a week, over a 3 to 4 month period, the total number of iPhones adds up fast!

Last I heard many years ago, Dave was serving time in jail. If I had to guess, I'd bet he'd probably tell you now that the theft wasn't worth it.",apple,"The man who stole over $100,000 in iPhones from Apple by walking them out the front door",2833,"['Believable and interesting.\n\nWhat era was this?

I've been holding onto this story for a long while now. I've told friends and family about this, and a few coworkers knew about this as well. I've never seen it posted anywhere before, so I figured this would be a good place to share the story. I'm fairly positive this was handled 100% silently and internally by Apple and their temp agency Volt. I don't think there's any reason not to share this publicly, so here it is.

A long time ago, during the iPhone 4 and 4s era, myself and other recent computer science graduates from college took 'Technician' jobs at Apple in Elk Grove, CA, doing repair work on iPhones and iPads. That's what we were *told* it would be anyways; as it turned out it was mainly just 'diagnostic' work, and the 'diagnostics' were tapping the screen to make sure various features were working.

This was a painfully boring job, and the tests were so poorly designed that we ended up failing probably close to a thousand iPads for wifi problems that actually had no wifi problems at all. There were many other issues with the tests that, to this day, still has me wondering how they managed to be implemented... but that's not what this story is about. I digress.

The work was divided into stations. The first couple stations would grab the iPhones (or iPads in the iPad line) that came in and factory reset them using iTunes, each station using about 8 computers simultaneously for higher throughput. The rest of the stations down the line would take each phone and test it for a specific function to make sure it was working. Phone calls, speakerphone, wifi, screen issues, etc.

The work was performed in a warehouse that was fenced in with metal detectors and security all over the entrances. At the time, you were allowed to bring in your phones. If you had an iPhone, you had to register the serial number with security. They would give you a laminated print out with your name and the serial number, and when walking through security you had to show them the print out as well as the serial number on your actual phone. You also had to move the screen around so they could verify it wasn't just a picture of the serial number that you put on the phone.

Attempted theft was surprisingly common. I recall at least a few people that were caught attempting to sneak out iPhones. The most notable of which was the man who put a few phones into his pockets, walked through the metal detector after his shift, and when it went off he dashed for the door in a full blown sprint. Hilariously, *this guy was huge and didn't run very fast at all*, and security got to him *within seconds*.

Successful theft also happened. One of my colleagues later admitted to me (after my employment was long over) that he got an iPhone out on his last day of employment by wearing a giant belt buckle and took an iPhone to the bathroom (located inside the secured area) and taped the iPhone to his skin directly underneath the buckle. When metal detectors went off, security would pull out those metal detector wands and scan you down, and if you showed them your belt buckle was setting it off they'd just let you walk through after the rest of your body was scanned. I always wondered if he prepped the night before making sure he was very smoothly shaven so he wouldn't rip out hairs when removing the phone (lol).

Now to the main point of the story: one newer technician who we'll call Dave, about a few months into his 12 month contract, came up with a very creative way to get iPhones out of the building. During this time, none of us knew what was going on, all we knew was that Dave had a station that he really liked working at; the receiving station. For most of us it was the worst station to work at because your speed set the pace for the rest of the line, and it never had any downtime. We almost always just let him have that station. Even when stations were rotated or assigned by management, he usually managed to hang on to that one by talking his way into it.

As time went on, some of us started realizing that Dave had 2 iPhones he would bring with him in to work, and then take out back through security every day. One of us asked him about it and he said he had a personal phone and a second phone for a side business he was running. A satisfactory answer for us; nobody asked him about it again.

More months passed, and I got a job offer at another company for a 'real' IT position, and several of the techs hired with me were at the end of their 12 month contract, so there was a sudden rotation in people. A couple weeks after my employment ended, I got a call from one of my former colleagues about Dave. Apparently, one of the new techs was inspecting Dave's work really closely, and noticed that Dave was rooting (jailbreaking) some of the iPhones he was working on, and changing the serial numbers to match the serial numbers on his laminated print outs.

Dave would simply walk out to his car with 2 iPhones during lunch, drop them off at his car, walk back in empty handed, and walk back out at the end of the day with 2 more iPhones.

The tech reported him to management and he was arrested. Apple was quiet about the numbers and details, but those of us who worked that specific line who had been at Apple for a while could put 2 and 2 together, and we knew exactly how long this was going on. Figuring that Dave would have easily been able to steal 4 iPhones a day most days, 5 days a week, over a 3 to 4 month period, the total number of iPhones adds up fast!

Last I heard many years ago, Dave was serving time in jail. If I had to guess, I'd bet he'd probably tell you now that the theft wasn't worth it.",44,1211,39,"[3, 1, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 6, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]","[24, 20, 131, 24, 75, 55, 32, 33, 8, 23, 23, 45, 44, 5, 89, 15, 45, 56, 3, 48, 4, 113, 6, 3, 14, 97, 6, 31, 2, 70, 8, 38, 6, 132, 3, 6, 6, 19, 3]",2.1538461538461537,35.0

For me, I won't be upgrading until probably the year after next year or maybe even longer than that given that I'll be waiting on what happens with 5G, what my carrier has to offer and the maturing of 5G technology. People are happy to pay a grand for a phone and upgrade when they see features that benefit them - the market has matured but I guess the 'doom and gloom' merchants over at CNBC need to hit their click quota for the month."", 'Apple iPhone sales: drops 12% yoy, iPhone XR is the bestselling phone on the market in the US, overall revenue up 1% due to services and wearables\n\nSamsung revenue down 56% yoy, galaxy s10 sales weak and chipsets demand down\n\nCNBC: yep, judging from these numbers we can only conclude one thing! Apple and Samsung are in the same boat, charging too much for cell phones.ü§¶üèª\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nWith very little research we can see that the slow in iPhone sales is due to longer upgrade cycles and increased prices, yes. But it is foolish to place Apple and Samsung in the same boat. The S10 isn‚Äôt selling well because there are better phones at lower prices running Android. Samsung is sliding in the cellular market as new Kings take the crown.\n\nApple continues to be a profit leader, and sells more flagship phones than any competitors in the price range. The factors affecting Apple and Samsung are very different. There are simply better alternatives to the S10 now, vs iPhone still being the only iPhone. The decrease in iPhone sales isn‚Äôt due to a change in competition providing headwinds, but it‚Äôs due to general cell phone market stagnation and decline.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry though, CNBC left out the other market leaders, because it would go against their narrative to include them. The Pixel 3a allowed google to double their sales last quarter, which isn‚Äôt saying much because sales of the pixel line were always in the low 2-4 million range. At least now they hit a price point that users will actually pay for a pixel device.\n\nConsidering this is our second year with $1000+ phones, and sales are only just declining, it‚Äôs hard to assume it‚Äôs due to the price. If the price were really so bad, we would not have seen the iPhone X perform as the best selling smartphone for nearly all of 2018. \n\nNo, I‚Äôd say pricing for the premium quality of the iPhone you get is fine. The decline seems to be lengthening upgrade cycles and the effect of an overall smartphone market decline. We need another year or two to decide whether or not price is the factor, or something else.\n\nBut whose to blame CNBC for this write up?
