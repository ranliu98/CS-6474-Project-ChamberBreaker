Kyle Vogt seems to disagree, in principle,  with folks who say that.\n\nFirst, I've never heard anyone doing deep learning say that (all else equal) more data isn't better.  I will say from firsthand experience that you definitely reach a point of diminishing returns where more data and a correspondingly larger and more complicated neural network doesn't help you significantly.  Covering important edge cases can get trickier as your corpus of training data grows, and the important but rare data gets numerically dominated by more commonplace scenarios (data balancing is a whole different, complicated topic).\n\nYou definitely can use various triggering strategies to semi-automate data labeling.  I have used such strategies in the past for anomaly detection problems, and sometimes it works quite well.  But you still always need to review the automatically labeled data you receive.  And you also need to review enough unlabeled data to make sure you are not getting a significant amount of false negatives (this is the real problem with semi-automated data labeling in my experience).  Deep neural networks are complicated nonlinear algorithms, and they often don't fail in straightforward ways such that you can just set your labeling threshold a little lower to collect all of the relevant data you want.  Also with semi-automated data labeling, you tend to get a significant amount of incorrect labels.  Someone needs to go through and exclude the irrelevant examples.  My point is, you still need a huge amount of human review of the data."", "">Some folks have argued that Tesla's \\~100-1000x quantity of real world miles relative to competitors is useless because more data is only valuable if you pay people to label it and it's just too expensive for Tesla to label much more data than anyone else \n\nI think folks are primarily arguing that the 100-1000x quantity of data is irrelevant since L2 tech does not translate into L4 tech or behavior. For example, how many pedestrians or cyclists do you see on the freeway, where a majority of data collection and use of autopilot takes place? Little to none.

>The reason we want lots of data and lots of driving is to try to maximize the entropy and diversity of the datasets we have.

As I understand it, [entropy](https://towardsdatascience.com/information-entropy-c037a90de58f) is essentially the surprisingness or unpredictability of a data point. Or, to put it another way, the informativeness of a data point; the amount of novel information contained in the data point.

Kyle Vogt also says some interesting stuff on automatic labelling or auto-labelling ([22:27](https://youtu.be/O6t7P1a7dyY?t=22m27s)):

>...basically, what I mean is you take the human labelling step out of the loop. ... There's a lot of things you can infer from the way a vehicle drives. If it didn't make any mistakes, then you can sort of implicitly assume a lot of things were correct about the way that vehicle drove. ... When the AVs are basically driving correctly and the people in the car are saying 'you did a good job', that, to me, is a very rich source of information. 

Kyle Vogt's statements about dataset entropy/diversity and automatic labelling seem applicable to Tesla.

For video clips that are labelled by humans (for use in fully supervised learning for computer vision), the benefit of Tesla's fleet driving ~700 million miles a month is the entropy, diversity, and rarity of the training examples that can be automatically flagged by various signals. Those signals include:

* deep learning-based queries (e.g. look for [bikes mounted on vehicles](https://youtu.be/33K3id2xNAE))
* [novelty detection](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/novelty-detection)
* [uncertainty estimation](https://www.inovex.de/blog/uncertainty-quantification-deep-learning/)
* human interventions (e.g. when Autopilot is disengaged)
* disagreements between the trajectory taken by a human driver and the trajectory generated by the software planner (e.g. [Aurora](https://slideslive.com/38916646/the-promise-and-challenge-of-ml-in-selfdriving) uses this as a signal)

In other words, using a combination of human signals and machine signals to trigger uploads, a higher quantity of data leads to a higher quality of dataset. 

With automatic labelling, Tesla can leverage a vast amount of data for:

 2. Self-supervised (a.k.a. unsupervised) learning for [prediction](https://youtu.be/A44hbogdKwI)

3. [Imitation learning](https://youtu.be/v5l-jPsAK7k) (and possibly reinforcement learning) for planning

There may also be some potential for [self-supervised learning for computer vision](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1193771034962325504?s=21), but I don't yet really understand how that would work. This is a topic I'd like to learn more about if anyone can suggest any beginner-friendly reading on this.

So, I interpret Kyle Vogt as agreeing, in principle, with the idea that more real world driving data is better and that human labour requirements don't negate the usefulness of more data.

Some folks have argued that Tesla's ~100-1000x quantity of real world miles relative to competitors is useless because more data is only valuable if you pay people to label it and it's just too expensive for Tesla to label much more data than anyone else. Kyle Vogt seems to disagree, in principle, with folks who say that.

I'm not an expert on machine learning or autonomous vehicles, so I could be wrong about any of this. I'm just explaining how I understand things from a layperson's perspective.",26,705,7,"[8, 4, 15, 5, 12, 3, 6]","[170, 78, 383, 160, 219, 42, 129]",7.571428571428571,168.71428571428572,"{'Kyle Vogt':

Tesla has ""AutoPilot vs Self driving""

Other makers seem to have escalating features:

1. Adaptive Cruise control - How to differentiate one that starts/stops in traffic vs one that cuts off below a set speed.
2. Lane keeping - Not just beeping when I drift, one that will follow curves in the highway, etc
3. Emergency braking, etc - something that reacts and stops for me if I'm distracted with the radio or something

And since guessing is free (just like on the SAT), I'll guess 2055.\n\nWith respect to L4, by tweaking the ODD (of which the oft-mentioned 'geofence' is an element), you can arrive at a range of answers going from 'now' to sometime just before 2055😉.\n\nFor me the real question is: Available to do what?

In a city like San Francisco, unless there are streets designated as AV (or possibly AV/Bus) only, we may see small pockets of autonomy in the less-dense neighborhoods, but downtown, i don't expect to see that wholesale transformation for quite a while. (Solving autonomy 99% leaves an awful lot of no-go's for a taxi service.)

As long as the car can simply hand responsibility back to the driver as it drives off the cliff, it doesn't matter whether it is L2, L3 or L4, it is equally useless.\n\nConversely, a car which can *legally* self drive in a very narrow range of conditions (in a dedicated lane, during certain traffic conditions, in specific areas) is really, really useful, despite not fitting any SAE level.\n\nI think the latter is where self-driving starts."", 'I think this is an interesting article addressing this: https://medium.com/may-mobility/the-moores-law-for-self-driving-vehicles-b78b8861e184', 'I don\'t know, but I\'m convinced Japan will get there first at mass scale.

Instead you start with a small area and keep growing it as you get better until you have reached the economic optimum,serving most people but not all.\n\nAnd of course, Waymo already does that in Chandler, AZ with a limited audience and will soon expand that audience and add silicon valley.   So the answer to your question depends on ""where you live?"" and is in all cases, ""As soon as a company has made their vehicle safe enough where you live, and regulations allow it, and it is worthwhile commercially do do it.""', 'L5 will depend a lot on how well L4 works.

But, when they got the chauffeur, the person got dropped off at work and then, to avoid the cost of parking, had the chauffeur drive their car all the way back home, only to come to pick them up again at the end of the day. This person effectively doubled their VMT just so they could avoid parking, a scenario AV researchers warn as more or less the worst-case scenario of an unregulated AV future.\n\nOf course a robo-taxi has no reason to go back ""home"", so the dire conclusions of the study don\'t apply.', ""Interesting. I'd like to see more geographically diverse studies with a larger pool of people."", ""I love SDCs but I largely agree with the conclusion.  If you make transportation easier, safer, better, more relaxing then people will definitely do more of it.  And that's a good thing.\n\nWill this make traffic worse if we don't do anything about it?  Probably.  But why would we do nothing about it?\n\nOne solution is to introduce micropayment based tolls on roads to help meter usage at peak times.  When a computer is making navigation decisions, it could easily reason about toll trade-offs without bothering the driver.\n\nAnother solution is to fix the real source of the problem: broken housing policy that causes jobs to be so far from housing"", ""This presupposes that the owners and/or the vehicles won't optimize the list of tasks that the vehicle has to perform, especially the tasks which can be  done at any time of day. Why return home if it can park near either it's last task or next task, and simply wait? Why not do convenient tasks for other people or bother to even own the vehicle in the first place? Maybe they should have modeled taxis instead of chauffeurs."", ""Interesting article if only it wasn't so breathlessly written."", 'Congestion is really a side issue.  The main issue is accidents, injuries and deaths from human error.  Which will all definitely drastically improve with self-driving cars.\n\nOne thing not mentioned is the fact that most of the time vehicles have one passenger but are very large and weigh more than 3,000 pounds since they are designed to accommodate 4, 5 or up to 8 passengers.  As we deploy automated driving widely we can move to much smaller single passenger vehicles as well as even smaller cargo vehicles for most trips that will use massively less space and could increase road capacity by up to a factor of four or more.\n\nAlso, not needing to steer the car means for some that you can start work before you actually get there, so that people will have more flexibility in when they leave and that will take pressure off of rush hour.\n\nAlso, since these are fully modern electronic automated systems, flexible and intelligent automatic taxation can be used to regulate congestion by encouraging people to avoid the most congested (and therefore expensive) travel times.  The fact that its totally digital could facilitate routing based on shared data and even allow minimum service levels to be enforced.', 'This:  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/what-does-law-diminishing-marginal-utility-explain.asp\n\nPeople would get use to it and wouldn’t use it as much.\n\nGo from riding a bus to having a chauffeur, even for a week...of course your going to use the hell out of it.\n\nHave a chauffeur for a decade and...meh.', 'one week is hardly long enough for people to accommodate to the idea. try it for a few months and see what paterns emerge.', 'If these autonomous vehicles were electrically powered this would not necessarily even be a problem.

Drastic reduction of car ownership at onset of FSD\n2. Drastic reduction of traffic due to smart routing and wider lanes due to:\n3: Drastic reduction of parking spaces needed along streets and in garage facilities.\n4. Charge lots where FSD vehicles will park outside of busy city centers. No need to drive far if vehicle is taken out of the active pool.', ""“All these things the self-driving car can do for you in the future,” Harb summarized, “a chauffeur can do for you today.”  Who's paying for the Chauffeur? What about the precise automated lanekeeping,and computerized radar controlled spatial awareness for automated cars?  Aren't AV's going to be EV's? reducing pollution rather than adding to it? One stat I find interesting about car ownership is that for a majority of owners,90% of the time a car is stationary,parked somewhere.. Car sharing services rather than outright ownership would become more prevalent with AV's-hail a car when you need one rather than be paying for one sitting still..Fewer cars on the road,being used more efficiently-not sending a car all the way home after dropping you off at work so that it's doing double the mileage-More Robo Taxi,the car is then available for someone else's use.."", 'It’s hard to take jalopnik serious.

I'd try to get them to talk in general about issues they face and hope some good info slips by PR. For example:\n\n\\- What tools do you use to measure safety and how much safety improvement do you need before expanding to all of Phoenix? (Tool talk causes PR hack's eyes to glaze over).\n\n\\- You collect much more feedback from real-world public users than anyone else. What kind of issues do riders bring up today, and how does it compare to one year ago?\n\n\\- You're on your 3rd or 4th generation of LIDAR. How did you make such large improvements each round, and how many more rounds do you need to reach the cost and performance needed to deploy hundreds of thousands of cars?\n\n\\- What features do you foresee in future custom-designed Robotaxis that aren't practical in today's Chrysler Pacificas and Jaguar i-Paces?\n\n\\- You progressed from the world's first completely driverless test in Austin in 2014 to regular driverless testing in Chandler in 2017 to daily driverless rides for Early Access riders today. This puts you on pace for \\~10% of rides being driverless in 2-3 years and close to 100% 2-3 years after that. Do you see potential breakthroughs that might accelerate this pace?\n\n\\- Elon Musk says Tesla will have a million robotaxis by mid-2020. Even if he's six months late as usual, how can you compete with less than 1000 vans? Do you worry about getting left in the dust like Xerox PARC who invented the mouse and graphical user interface only to see Apple and Microsoft win the market?\n\n\\- It's impossible to predict breakthroughs. In February 2018 \\[NEED ACTUAL DATE\\] your CEO forecasted commercial service without safety drivers by yearend. What were the three biggest technical issues behind the delay, and how are you attacking them?\n\nThe last three questions are poorly formed, and I wouldn't ask all three.

Driving a car does not keep you healthy.   Americans already have an extreme aversion to walking any more than about a quarter-mile.    I see plenty of drivers who think that self driving cars are for the lazy because the car is doing all the work.  The car is already doing all the work.   If you want to put in some effort, go out and walk.    \n\n\nI do think however that driverless taxi service will enable much more pedestrian lifestyles, which may include changes to urban design that make areas more walkable to where people will go from driving 100% of the time, to using SDC taxis for longer trips and walking for shorter.  But that is me being optimistic.  Most people will probably use the SDCs for everything and still avoid walking, even if downtown areas greatly transform.', 'I just wanna sit in the car for like long cross country journeys and read my books or work on my laptop. that would be so amazing :P\n\n like taking a train, but with a bit more privacy I guess.', ""My grandma would buy a self driving car in a heart beat.\n\nSimply so she can go somewhere else other than being limited to the surrounding area of her flat.\n\nShe's not driving any longer, reaction time and all, doesn't see too well anymore either.

But she's also limited to that neighborhood, which does get boring.\n \n\nYou know like...just drive somewhere and go take a walk there and not the same routes around your flat over and over again. Visit the grand kids, her sister and friends without being dependent on the bus or that somebody drives her. Or just go shopping in some different shops every now and then.

Look at the engineering and management failures that we still have with much more highly regulated forms of transportation like rail and airplanes."", 'I am personally optimistic for myself as transportation as a service will allow me to get around much cheaper than car ownership.   I am lucky that I am able to do all my work stuff/grocery store/target/shopping mall stuff without using a car.   Me personally, this is going to involve me saving a bunch of money by doing all my car activities without owning a car or paying for all of the costs of car ownership.    \n\n\nNow the cultural, societal, and economic changes, which will lag, they will take longer than the technology, but I think by 4-5 years after the launch of TAAS they will be obvious and by 2030 the changes in society will be in full swing.    \n\n\nThe cost of reliable, on demand, point to point transportation will drop drastically.  Right now there is ride sharing, which is expensive, and car ownership, which is also expensive and has a lot of responsibilities with it.   TAAS will be all-electric and drastically cheaper per mile than an existing gasser car (without any carbon taxes applied, which could happen).   People can now pay for rides as they need them rather than paying for huge capital expenses on depreciating assets, insurance costs, fuel costs, vehicle maintenance costs, and storage costs (which in many cities, monthly parking rentals are very expensive).   The poor people will afford to get around to handle their business, lower and middle-income people will not have to sink huge portions of their car ownership (this is especially true for multiple car families, which other than collectors I think will mostly disappear from American society).   Spending money on cars is not a good financial investment, but it is needed because people need to get around.  After TAAS people will not need to spend money on cars unless they are enthusiasts, which is about 10% of the population.   By buying rides people will free themselves of the financial burdens of car ownership,  for lower and middle income people this will allow them to have more cash to save or spend elsewhere in the economy.    \n\n\nI am excited to see cities transform from prioritizing car traffic and car parking to pedestrian and other uses.  Parking lots will turn into green spaces, high-density housing (which no longer needs several hundred parking spaces per building),  commercial space.   Just within Los Angeles, there is like 100-150 square miles of parking, at 33 people per acre this can house over 2 million people.   I think densities can go much higher than 33 people per acre in places like Los Angeles.   In places with $1M per acre real estate its going to make more sense doing major development vs maintaining parking.    \n\n\nIts going to take longer, but we are going to see cities rapidly transform and allow for much larger populations to live very comfortably.  As all of the cars will ultimately be EVs, the local air pollution will also get much better.  Smog will mostly be a thing of the past.   I do think this will create more pedestrian-friendly areas and we will see things like major footbridges in cities with very busy streets.  Something like the High Line in New York  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line) Ways that a lot of people can walk around and are separated from the cars that both do not slow down the cars and do not slow down people.', 'As a long time driver and “car nut”, I am not that interested in ""Self Driving"" cars, but am really interested in vehicles with improved Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS). \n\n(I think that as the general public learns and has experience with vehicles with good ADAS, it will become as standard as automatic transmissions or power steering). Here\'s what we really need...\n\nIntegrated Adaptive Cruise and Lane Centering with improved feedback.\n\nThe Adaptive Cruise has to improve so it can ""see"" vehicles (in my lane) farther ahead than all the current systems can – maybe even on slight curves, and be able to automatically go into a “coast"" mode, starting to gently slow approaching that stopped vehicle farther ahead of me before automatically breaking.  And the current “time-out"" period (after you\'ve stopped), of about only 3 seconds should be a user setting of up to 3 minutes.\n\nThe Lane Centering has to improve and keep me absolutely centered in the lane with no ping-ponging, (an automated steering system should be able to stay centered in the lane much better than a human driver can). It should increasingly handle sharper curves (than current systems). It should also slightly favor the inside of curves as most adjacent traffic does. It should include side-sensors that automatically prevent me from accidentally approaching any vehicles adjacent to me.\n\nLastly the GUI (Graphic User Interface) must completely change from tiny indistinguishable icons to bold interfaces like Cadillac’s Steering Wheel on their “Super Cruise”.\n\n(In the Caddy, the whole top of the steering wheel displays an **“impossible-to-miss**” color code. – (an alternative could be a large color LED on the leading edge of the “IP” just above the steering wheel.))\n\nThen rather than the driver constantly having to scan the IP (or HUD) in the vehicle to determine the current “ADAS STATUS”, (distracting attention from actually driving), there would be a single large display immediately “in his face”\n\n**BLACK** = Radar Cruise is OFF – YOU ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL\n\n**RED** = Radar Cruise is ON holding constant speed  - BE PREPARED TO MANUALLY BRAKE AS REQUIRED.\n\n**GREEN** = Radar Cruise is ON and Engaged on Target and will AUTO BRAKE.\n\nWith a status display like that, a driver would no longer have to be distracted from watching the traffic in front of him to scan the IP and find and check the status of multiple miniature icons, but have a simply LARGE CLEAR immediate display directly in front that would be difficult to miss or misinterpret.']","What are you most excited about? Self driving cars. Well, since self-driving cars are really starting to take off, i thought i would make a list of the things im MOST excited about self-driving cars.

1. No tickets EVER! The car won't speed, or ever hit anything so traffic cops will become non existant, no one will ever get a traffic ticket and that will free up SO MUCH MONEY to build charging stations and greenspaces by having to pay less police officers just to do ""traffic patrol"" or whatever. Dont know about where you live, but rookie cops here make 85k a year. So having a couple hundred less of them will save TONS of money.

2. Drinking! Many laws will change, for example, yes, drink behind the wheel, why not? Youre not driving. No more DUIS!

3. People are terrible drivers. Putting liability on the auto manufacturer means the cars have to be safe.

4. NO CAR INSURANCE! Because car insurance covers the PERSON driving the car, and self driving cars won't have any accidents, there will be no need for car insurance as the very small number of ""accidents"" will be totally covered by the manufacturer. Since it is caused by their tech, just like the takata airbag malfunctions were paid for by the manufacturer. Also, this means WAY LESS insurance agents who i have always felt were overpaid for what they do. AWESOME!

5. SAFETY! NO ONE WILL EVER DIE IN A CAR WRECK AGAIN. lets face it. SDCs are computers and thus MUCH smarter than people. Faster reaction time, etc. Every car accident in the world is caused by some kind of driver error and computers dont EVER MAKE ERRORS! does your calculator ever make a math mistake? NO! And thats what SDCs will do. No more accidents at all. 

6. Mentioned earlier drinking, but really, do whatever you want behind the wheel, play on your phone, gameboy, sleep, eat, put on makeup, have sex, watch tv, get dressed for work. All while getting where youre going FASTER AND SAFER.

7. LESS CARS ON ROAD! Well, once all the normies who drive regular cars die in wrecks (because of course they will, they dont have a robot driver) there will be way less cars on the road and everything will be WAY safer, because it's all robots.

8. PAVES THE WAY FOR WIDESPREAD BODY ACCEPTANCE. Well, along with being too lazy to drive, most will be too lazy to do other things and the world will turn into a WALL-E movie scenario where everyone is lazy and overweight. THIS IS THE BEST PART because it will make our whole society more accepting, since EVERYONE will be fat. I know i spend most of my disposable income on food, so once i have to pay less taxes for traffic police and no insurance, I'll have a couple hundred a month to dump into doritos and mountain dew, which is anyone's dream life.

It may not always look like things are moving fast, but things are moving pretty fast. Google started what 10-12 years ago? So with things moving quickly, who wants to pull engineers off the main project of full self driving (which risks falling behind) in order to work on a much more limited form? Let's assume most of the work is already done and making vehicles for SDC corridors is just polish and UX design. Even with that, what government wants to make the commitments needed for an SDC corridor that might be outdated when it is finished? Being the mayor that brought an SDC corridor to town will be cool if it works, but really bad if real full SDCs come out a month after you announce the corridor. \n\nAssuming there is almost complete SDC tech ready to be repackaged out there, we get to point 2. This tech isn't evenly distributed. If there were public patents and everything was out in the open sure somebody would be trying to adapt it for corridors we can roll out sooner.

[14th street in NYC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg/1200px-14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg), [16th street in Denver](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/62/93/e462930ef726036a033298f009e7f2ef.jpg), etc.. these seem like prime use-cases for self-driving vehicles. you could even run a mix of SDC taxis and SDC shuttle vans in the same corridor. 5 shuttles would have roughly the capacity of 1 bus (typically $500k-750k), and cost less than 1/5th as much as a bus (depending on sensor cost). having a shuttle every 2 min would provide MUCH better service than 1 bus every 10min.

it should also be noted that transit planners love transit corridors like these. they typically don't get built because people don't like riding buses, and drivers get upset that their driving commute will be longer and that shady people will be standing around bus stops. SDCs have a sexy futuristic reputation that could excite mayors and citizens and get them to look past the bad reputation that buses have. so, if SDCs can be cool enough to convince cities to do what transit planners already want to do, there is a lot of potential there. it's also likely that SDC companies would offer to run the system with less government subsidy than buses in order to get their foot in the door, so it could be money-saving for a city also. once you have smaller ""buses"" you can start doing things like running every 5th van as an ""express"" that skips all but the busiest/transfer stops.

to me, it seems like an all-around win. bus riders get MUCH better service, transit planners can get transit corridors, mayors get lower budgets and cool tech to look progressive, and SDC companies get a nice walled-garden that they can curate to reduce edge-cases while they develop. as SDC tech gets better, the SDC companies can move from totally isolates streets to ones that have ""bus lanes"" and fixed, easy routes. then eventually city-wide operation.

The systems today are glorified filters. Conciseness requires relating movement and sensory inputs. There is also a feedback system which helps with attention. The first step will be to understand the neocortex and emulate its function. Numenta is the only research organization I’m aware of which is making meaningful progress in reverse engineering the neocortex. Once the architecture is implemented in a hardware solution to support parallelism and energy efficiency, it will not be long after if the size can match a rat.\nI’m expecting at least 10-15 years before we see such a system. Before then, we will see AI systems doing much of what humans can do but better. But we won’t see consciousness for over a decade. \nIt has been 35 years since I’ve imagined computers to become self conscious. Now I’m dreaming that I will be doing it. That is most doubtful. But this generation of engineers will be doing it.', '> If a Self-Driving car refuses an update, what do we do? \n\nreimage that shit', 'A lot of the ""models"" you highlight are likely not models, just hardcoded rules.\n\nBesides, all of the ""onboard"" code is inference only, I don\'t know of anyone updating their models on the fly.', 'I would like to break this down.\n\n""Consciousness"" is a very problematic word.  The way that you use it here, to refer to a human-like cognitive state in a vague way, definitely is not possible with a system like Waymo\'s.  In a more limited sense in terms of a specific type of integrated perception such as described here [https://lexfridman.com/christof-koch/](https://lexfridman.com/christof-koch/), I think Waymo is actually headed a bit in that direction, but lacks key qualities such as generality and scale so that it is still pretty far from Koch\'s concept of consciousness.\n\nIt doesn\'t make sense for the system to ""develop"" any emotion or for ""consciousness"" or anything else to ""emerge"".   Consciousness and emotion emerged over a process of evolution that took millions of years.  Emergence involves the operation of a large multitude of elements working together in a specific type of phenomenon.  There is no indication that the neural networks and other elements of Waymo\'s system have any characteristics that would allow this.  They are tuned  and integrated in a way that only allows for specific tasks.\n\nMy understanding is that all self-driving cars rely heavily on rule-base systems that supervise the operation of the neural networks which are tuned for narrow tasks.\n\nIt probably has most of the models you say, but they are more programmatic and narrow and not general purpose integrated cognition like humans or animals.\n\nIt is possible to engineer a system with something like emotions, but that is not going to happen accidentally.  It will require the emotional capabilities to be programmed explicitly such as [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00020/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00020/full), or for the system to have a fully general purpose architecture (which has not been invented yet) and which incorporates a level of system regulation that can approximate emotion.', 'You are over generalizing.  It might have a couple of rules for pleasing passengers, but that is far, far, far short of a general model for making humans happy.  Similarly ""understanding the world"" is limited to a handful of dimensions.  What they\'ve done is pretty sophisticated, but doesn\'t come anywhere close to what you would need for  consciousness.', ""SDCs are not sophisticated enough by a factor of a billion to be conscious. It's a non-issue."", "">This is a lot of intelligence.\n\nNo, it's not intelligence. it's a rules based outcome. It's not learning at all.\n\nWhat are you claiming as 'intelligence' here?\n\nComplex rules aren't intelligence"", ""There is no intelligence. The car is programmed what the programmers told it to do. If you tell a kid to do something and they do it, it doesn't show the child's intelligence. It merely displays that they can follow directions and execute the action, much like a driverless car."", ""A lot of folks seem to be focusing on the underlying architecture, and I think I disagree with this premise. Just because we know *how* the underlying systems work, or even if they are produced using a simple  rules-based approach for many of the behaviors, isn't really interesting to me because I think the only thing that matters is behavior. If an intelligent agent can behave in a way that appears to be conscious, I will treat it at such. If I'm fooled, I prefer that to the alternative.\n\nIt has to be about behavior, because some day we'll know how brains work and the answer's going to be 'not magic'."", 'Object recognition was intractable until the system had orders of magnitude more data and then it just ""happened"".\n\nwhat you\'re talking about, self awareness and a desire to act on that awareness for self preservation, is out still orders of magnitude further from where we are today.\n\nnot to mention it would require an algorithm that will surely never exist in a car. One that probably doesn\'t exist today. I say probably, but might. self preservation has to do with maximizing one\'s options.', 'So, we first have to consider that there are two ""pieces"" of consciousness: access consciousness, which is the ability to process incoming information, detect changes in the environment, and react to them, along with a limited form of metacognition, and phenomenal consciousness, which is the subjective part of consciousness, the ""what it is like"" to be something.  Phenomenal consciousness can be defined by having subject experience, or qualia (the what-it-is-likeness to see the color red or experience pain or euphoria, for example).  \n\nI believe that access consciousness already exists in limited forms in computer systems, and in something as complex as a neural network that can process the level of input required for a true self-driving car, it likely already has it.\n\nAs for subjective experience, it\'s kind of a moot point because we don\'t know where it comes from or how to actually measure it.  We know that when people tell us they\'re conscious, that certain brain structures are active, and when they tell us that they are not experiencing subjective reality, those structures are much less active.  But we don\'t know how information processing in the brain gives rise to consciousness.  It may be something that is unknowable due to limitations in our capacity for forming ideas, sort of like trying to visualize a four-dimensional space.  It may also be fundamental to the universe in the same way that electromagnetism is fundamental, i.e., you can\'t describe what electric charge is at a more basic level than calling a particular phenomenon that behaves in a certain way a charged particle in an EM field.  It\'s just something that\'s part of the universe we live in.  Finally, it may be based on the way that information is processed, that at certain levels of complexity and recursion, experience emerges out of it.\n\nUntil we know or at least have a glimpse of which one of those possibilities (or maybe another possibility altogether) gives rise to experience, we can\'t say whether or not something is conscious.  Personally, I believe that experience is a basic part of existence that comes up when certain complex forms of information processing give rise to a particular set of configurations in a ""qualia field"" that is as basic as the electromagnetic field, and that this qualia field couples with the EM field, so that our own subjective experience comes from this coupling.\n\nBasically, the problem right now is 1) we can\'t measure if something has phenomenal consciousness, we can only either believe it or disbelieve when it tells us it is, and 2) if phenomenal consciousness is a result of information processing, then we\'ve still got a ways to go.', ""I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

I know this sounds silly, but please here me out. I was just watching the new video TechCrunch released, where they hailed a real driveless car via the app and it got me thinking: this system is doing quite a lot. It has: 

* A model for understanding the world in a value/priority based hierarchy, as well as in 3 dimensional space, which it represents as a color-coded 3D render
* A predictive model of the world that can see possible different future world states, based on different actions it can make
* A model for understanding human behavior and intent, including reading hand gestures and possibly even facial expressions
* A model for understanding and complying with any local laws or regulations
* A model used to understand how to produce the happiest humans during its ride
* A model for handling everything else, and probably a few more than I forgot
* A master model to basically manage all of these different models to optimize for the overall goal of getting people from A-->B as quickly, safely, and happily as possible

This is a lot of intelligence. I would say this has to be at least as intelligent as all insects, and probably most fish. It would make sense for this model to develop things like stress, anxiety, and fear (i.e it will 'want' to avoid certain situations)as it is optimizing different world states and I have to imaging that this is how consciousness and sentience first appeared in life, since we have to do a lot of these same things. At what point should we start asking these questions?

The success of one SDC company makes all SDC companies look good, because it shows that their goals are achievable. The chief reason not to invest in SDC companies isn't competition, it's the risk that they will never make a marketable product or service. For this reason, you'd expect Waymo's success to make Uber, Zoox, etc. into more desirable investments, which translates into a higher share price for publicly traded companies, and more investment power for those that are privately held."", 'The roll out of SDCs is going to take a comparatively long time.   Its probably 7-10 years to they are in most populated places globally.\n\nLots of companies will be impacted but over a long timeframe.  Uber/Lyft could completely disappear in 7-10 years or they could make deals with self driving companies to keep them afloat.  Or they could be bought by someone to use their brand for a SDC.  Certainly if they do nothing the will go away.  But its hard to short the stock on a 7 year slow decline.\n\nInsurance will take a hit, airlines, hotels, road side businesses, etc.  But again this will be slow declines over long periods dont expect a 30% drop tomorrow.\n\nOn the positive side the shipping companies that utilize SDTs will have major upside.  Less accidents, trucks that can move 24x7,  no driver wages, etc.  But its hard to know who will really win out in that space.  Trucking companies might utilize a uber like SDT service.  This will reduce cost but ultimately also cause reductions in the price they can charge customers.  I am sure it is a net win but its not a major home run.\n\nUnfortunately - other than Tesla you really cannot invest directly into a SDC company.  You can buy alphabet stock for waymo which I think eventually will spin off into its own company but right now you dont have the 10X upside that could happen with a pure SDC company.', 'Can you short turnpike rest stops?', ""Retail is upended.

But more of a gradual process.\n\nDriver-less cars where invented more than 30 years ago, it is the implementation that has not.\n\nQuite honestly, I dont see how Waymo having a fully functional driverless car out tomorrow will change much right away.\n\n1. Their cars are geo-fenced, meaning 99.99% of the world is unaffected.\n2. They cant have a fast roll out as their business model scales linearly with their roll out. They need to Map and maintain the areas they operate in. They need to maintain each car themselves. Their cars are expensive.\n\nOver time, presuming that all the other companies do nothing, they will reach market penetration to effect other industries bottom line. Personally I think Waymo may have the best tech, but its coupled with the worst business model. Uber may be the same.\n\nTo have mass market influence, you need to show you can roll the system out in the hundreds of thousands to millions per year. I can only think of one company that can maybe do this within a few (1 - 5) years. But 1 car company themselves will not be able to do too much themselves. There are 70 million cars sold each year. You need to be in the ball park of at least 1 million cars a year before there will be any real market reaction. \n\nThere will not be only 1 self-driving car company, but many, as the market is too big.\n\nWho will get negatively influenced depends on how the technology pans out. \n\n* Real estate. People could chose to live and work further from city centers if they can do work while in transit. \n* Motels, BnB, AirBnB ext. People who travel for work often sleep over at the destination before driving back/further the next day. If you can sleep and travel, these industries will get hit.\n* Airlines. Especially on short routes 2 - 6 hour travel time. I spend more time at the airport than in the plane if I need to travel about 600km. Total time is about 4 hours, then I need to rent a car other side. I would rather take my own car if I could sleep or work on the way even if it took 6 hours (2 hours longer)', 'Uber and Lyft will drop first.', 'Non destination hotel companies. Why would you need a motorway : highway motel when you can sleep in your car?', ""That's because Uber is making driverless taxis."", 'Its way too early for this.

I am some random dude on reddit, do not base your future investments on anything I say.  This is the future I think is going to happen and I am personally planning for, some people think I am full of shit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we are missing the mark by framing this as ""invented"".  There are thousands of technologies, each an invention, which go into self-driving cars.  Like the modern smartphone, it is not ONE thing but many small things that come together.   Being invented really isn\'t the big news.    Product rollout is big news.  TCIP went live in 1983, the world wide web wasn\'t invented until 1990.  And even in 1990, the internet did not really make a major impact on the market.  It took a few years.    The key years were not invention, but customer adoption.  Waymo likely does have driverless cars,  but they do not really have any sort of market push or commercial service (if they did we would be using it.  They do have a closed group though).   The internet itself was not a market disruption, the market disruptions came later when the internet became good enough to do X, where X competed against an existing market product or service.   The internet came around long before Google, Amazon, Facebook,  Ebay,  Yahoo, or any of the other tech companies that monetized it.    \n\n\nSo instead of a binary Invented or Not Invented.  I am going to try to predict a few key points and how I think they will affect markets.  I am convinced the rollout in driverless technology will be most impactful with Self Driving Taxis, even if it is a Tesla that is privately owned and only \'borrowed\' by 8-10 friends/family members of the owners.    The big effect of Self Driving Cars is drastically bring down the cost of ride sharing.  As ride sharing gets cheaper more people can justify using it over driving.    \n\n\n [https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/10/if-you-drive-less-than-10000-miles-a-year-you-probably-shouldnt-own-a-car/542988/](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/10/if-you-drive-less-than-10000-miles-a-year-you-probably-shouldnt-own-a-car/542988/)  \n\n\nThis article makes the claim that if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, you should probably not own a car.   I actually disagree with that statement a bit.  But there is an annual mileage point where people won\'t justify a new car (assuming this person is not a car enthusiast, which makes up a minority of the market).    By not having a driver, and eventually being all-electric, and a distributed technology.  TAAS can bring the price down per ride fairly by a fairly large margin.   If your round trip to work can cheaply switch over to TAAS, you may do that, if your deliveries use TAAS, you may prefer to use those vs drive yourself to the store/restaurant.   Right now DoorDash/Postmates costs a minimum of a delivery fee, service charges (even when there is free delivery there will always be service charges) and a tip to the driver.     Eventually for a lot of consumers that 10,000 miles per year will start to be hacked away and replaced by TAAS.    \n\n\nWithin a service area, within a few days after launch, there will be a disruption to existing Taxi/uber/lyft services.   Even if the rides are just a few bucks cheaper than current rides.  The drivers in those existing models will see a drop of customers pretty quickly.   Maybe it doesn\'t affect the driver\'s income too much as they still do a lot of higher dollar rides outside the geofenced areas, but those geofenced areas will be constantly expanding.   But I can see a drop in revenue immediately scaring away a lot of investors for Lyft/Uber.     \n\n\nNew car sales.  Especially the more low to mid market for new car gasser sales.   For someone who already owns a car but thanks to TAAS, this person drives drastically less than they did before.  Perhaps they went from 12,000 miles per year to 4000 miles per year.   This person is not in the market for a new car.   Because they drive only 1/3rd of what they used to drive their existing car will last much longer, they won\'t see the need to buy a NEW car.  Not a new USED car, but a brand new from the factory NEW car.    They just do not drive enough to justify going into debt and having a major expense every month to have a brand new car when they only drive 350 miles per month.  A $350 per month car payment when you only drive 350 miles per month?  That is a no sale.     The other market are lower income people who can\'t justify paying for a car.   If giving up the car saves a few hundred per month,  people will give up their cars.    Teenagers will start off using TAAS and before they age into driving will probably not see the point in getting a job to buy a car when it costs less to get around anyway (major trend, teens are not driving, teens are delaying their licenses).   If TAAS can fulfill a person\'s needs, they will likely not bother with buying a new car.    Families may not need to own multiple cars as work commutes could be covered by TAAS and most day to day tasks won\'t require a car.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis to say that EVERYONE who is currently buying a new gas car will stop, but a lot of customers won\'t justify the purchase.     Car sales, especially ICE sales, do not need to drop 100% to fuck up the car companies, during the last recession it was a 40% decline in new car sales which nearly killed them.   A 40% decline in new car sales would just be a few million per year.    But I think this is going to be a bit more compounded, as many people will give up their car, and flood the used market with cars, crashing the price, so finance companies may not be so hot about giving people expensive car loans when they see used cars selling for cheap.  People realize that new cars lose value, but if that loss was much faster they may not be so gung ho on buying a new car.    \n\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2019/10/25/how-the-tesla-effect-is-crushing-used-luxury-car-values/#339f4f0924e8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2019/10/25/how-the-tesla-effect-is-crushing-used-luxury-car-values/#339f4f0924e8)  \n\n\nGas cars, especially premium market gas cars are going to get slaughtered.   Many times the high price is justified by a high resale value, but that resale value is going to plummet.   Electric cars, which the best ones are all at the premium end of the market, are going to compete head to head with these gassers.  TAAS and cheap used gassers are going to compete at the lower end of the new car market, and premium electrics are doing very well at the upper end of the market.   Next year we will see the Rivian R1T/R1S pickup/SUV and the Tesla pickup, they are as expensive as the high end pickups produced by the big 3 and will be competing directly against them.    As they will cost hundreds of dollars less per month in fuel they can justify a bit higher sticker price.   $50,000 Ford F-150 vs $70,000 Rivian R1T are roughly the same price if the monthly savings on gasoline is $300-$400 per month, anyone who spends more than $500 per month on gasoline will have a justification for the more expensive EV truck.    \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next price point will be when TAAS is cheaper than owning an existing car that has already been paid for.  To where when you add up your average annual maintenance cost, parking costs, insurance costs, and fuel costs, TAAS isn\'t just a little cheaper, but TAAS is way cheaper.   To where the act of giving up your car will save hundreds of dollars per month.    This will just further expand the market of people who will never buy a car, and people who will flood the market with used cars, drastically pushing down the price for a used car.    When people claim that rural people will never adopt TAAS, they will ALWAYS drive their own car and do not want an EV and only want a gasser (which I do not think is true, rural people have a lot to gain from EVs and I think they will use TAAS) but these folks will have a market full of super cheap gassers, they won\'t buy new gassers.     \n\n\nThe market for new has powered cars will shrink.  The number of used gasser cars on the market will explode.  Companies dependent on new car sales will suffer.   New car sales will primarily exist in only the premium market and they will be all-electric and most people will not bother owning them.   A new gasser car will have terrible resale value and people will be reluctant to buy them.   There will not be enough customers to keep the gasser production viable.    \n\n\nI think the big one that will take a hit will be oil companies.  Oil companies have been investing in infrastructure that is only profitable when oil prices are high.  If the demand for oil drops, there will be a glut of oil on the market and prices will fall.  Expensive extraction methods will not be profitable and will shut down.  Just built investments will become stranded assets.   From the talks I have seen, it doesn\'t take a massive drop in demand to just kill the price of oil and much of the oil infrastructure is not profitable at low prices.   If oil is $25 per barrel and extraction method X costs $40 per barrel then its a no go.', 'Airlines.', ""I wouldn't expect Uber shares to go down too much.

The van did a great job, and that’s what seems to bug people.', '>Something not currently available to the robocar is what a human driver would have done – made eye contact with the illegal driver and come to some sort of non-verbal agreement about who was going. \n\nI laughed at how in reality the numerous times the ""non-verbal agreement"" by human drivers involves dirty looks, shouting obscenities, and threats  or pure WTF bewilderment by the human drivers instead of any sort of ""agreement"" on who should proceed.\n\nThis article sounds like my grandmother wrote it about how she thinks SDCs should work.', '> If this is an error by the Waymo system, it will quickly enter their test suite, and a variety of versions of it will be created in their simulator, so they can tells all new versions of the software against drivers of this type, and do the right thing. \n\nThe author did a pretty poor job of explaining why they think what the Waymo car did wasn\'t the right thing.\n\nA self-driving car avoids collisions by navigating around stationary objects and tracking the predicted path of moving objects. A car can\'t just assume that a stationary car is going to accelerate and T-bone them out of nowhere. It can\'t just stop and say ""I\'m going to wait for this car to move"" because it might not ever move.\n\nIf the car to the left did start lurching forward into the Waymo car\'s path, it likely would have stopped. But the car beside it wasn\'t moving so it was safe to complete the turn.\n\nAs far as I can tell, if the Waymo car was driving completely autonomously then it made the correct decision.', '> The Waymo van had the right-of-way and the video car was stopped. At the same time it is surprising that a robocar would not switch into a mode of great caution in the presence of a driver driving the wrong direction in a lane, particularly when it comes to cutting left right in front of that vehicle, even when it has just stopped. A human driver would actually be able to see the video camera and figure out what was going on here, and know it was probably safe, but I’m fairly confident the car isn’t that smart. My most likely conclusion is that the car did not become cautious because the other car was in the other lane, everybody was stopped, and there was no conflict of right-of-way.\n\nThe complaint seems to be that a human would\'ve identified the wrong-way driver as erratic and not have trusted them enough to pull ahead and take the left turn in front of them (fearing that the erratic driver might drive into the SDC as the SDC turns).\n\nThe alternative would be:\n\n* stop and wait for the erratic driver to pass them.\n* take a right turn and find an alternate route.\n\nStopping and waiting for the erratic driver is not good. The SDC would be behaving in an unpredictable way: stopping when no one is in front of them, and would encourage the erratic driver to do something even more unpredictable and dangerous: pass them at an intersection and turn into the intersection from the wrong lane.\n\nChanging routes and turning right would\'ve been pretty good on the surface, but the system might\'ve identified the erratic driver as an ""intrigued by SDCs and wants to see the driver\'s seat"" pattern. Given that everyone was stopped and there were no vehicles coming, taking a left would be safe since a driver following this pattern could be trusted not to run into them (if they were in fact following this pattern). The other problem with taking a right is that the SDC could be exploited by ""griefers"" who might force the car to continually take rights and loop around the block by continually driving next to the car at each intersection. Hopefully, someone would call the cops if that was done, but taking the left does de-incentivize this behavior.\n\nIn a more general sense, all drivers must trust others to some extent, or we\'d be braking the law by obstructing the flow of traffic. I think the Waymo van did the right thing here.', '[deleted]', ""Given time, Waymo will likely handle this situation and other corner-cases better than a real driver. \n\n* You just have to program the optimal decision once and it won't forget unlike people.\n* At some point (in the probably distant future) there will be more self driving cars and fewer erratic drivers so it'll be an even smaller corner case. The few that do drive will be mainly enthusiasts and hopefully non-terrible drivers."", 'I’ve never seen dirtier car windows', '> Waymo has informed me that the van did detect the video car driving to the left of it, and stayed stopped at the sign while it was moving, but after the video car came to a full stop, it decided it was safe to make its left turn.

You also need domain knowledge, like there will be a way to get to the driver, even if it's not obvious, so I should drive around and create a map and try to solve the problem. \n\nHonestly, I've always wanted to solve this problem in a different way. You need to understand the environment beyond the vehicles sensors, so raise the sensors. Use a small drone that gets launched to see the lot from an overhead view. Drone, isn't needed for most driving, but from overhead you can probably understand a parking lot, and predict movement of people and cars very easily. You launch it in parking lots or around construction or an accident.\n\nOn the other hand maybe you can do a grid to vehicle thing where there are cameras everywhere and any vehicle can tap into the video of feed. Processing is still all done on board, but you can always grab a camera feeds from around the lot or from around the corner, to add an additional sensor.

Any training system that depends on neural nets, deep learning etc can learn to emulate its inputs (whether it comes from human responses or training) but it will never reach 100% accuracy. The types of inputs or sensors (vision or LIDAR) don't really matter, or whether is supervised or unsupervised/evolved learning.

We just don't know how to solve this. Promises such as that made by Tesla about achieving Level 4/5 in a year are nonsense. If we did know to do this, it would apply to a wide class of AI problems.

The current best we have, e.g. AlphaGo, is impressive because its problem space is still highly limited compared to driving, and its criteria for success is beating the best human. Or e.g. diagnosis using medical scans, which can also achieve better accuracy than humans but isn't close to 100%.

People thought back in the 50s/60s that AI would reach a golden age in a few decades. Nothing happened. The recent advances have been due to availability of massively more computational power as well as new machine learning techniques, but we still have no clue about how intelligence/consciousness actually works.

The best we can hope for is a network with massive intelligence (i.e. sensors) built in and every car networked and exchanging information. Even that is a pipe dream and the stuff of scifi.

Players like Waymo and GM Cruise should avoid the temptation of using their vast amount of capital to engage in head-on competition with entrenched incumbents.\n\nThe problem with this, at least for Cruise, is that a lot of their promised investment money from Softbank is incumbent on them launching their ride-sharing service commercially.\n\nThe only reason they have any investment money is because the investors want to see the ride share service launched. If they tried to pivot, there would be a lot of pissed off investors and probably a few lawsuits.\n\nThe other thing the authors are missing is the fact that ride-hailing will likely be ""commoditized"" soon. Nobody\'s going to open up the Uber app and wait for an Uber. They\'ll open Google Maps, find their destination, and then select whichever ride service that Google Maps says is faster or cheaper or whatever the user is looking for. Nobody wants to have 5 different ride-hailing apps on their phone and try to figure out which one is best for the spot they happen to be in at any given moment.', ""The issue is what happens when Waymo has the technology and Uber/Lyft don't.  Sure, they are the incumbents with the established brands in ride-hail.  But as they always say in the employee/contractor battle, they are not a ride service, they are an app, which provides services to drivers.   To the public, they are a brand.\n\nSo a new Waymo service is not the same business at all.  It's a real ride service, and not a service for drivers who play no part.    And, if Waymo decides to make use of the Google brand, from the world's top global brand.    This disruption is that it's a completely different product."", ""If I had to bet on who would win here I'd probably split my bets evenly between Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, Uber, Lyft.\n\nAlthough personally I think Uber/Lyft are like Nokia. They are far ahead now, but I think the tech barrier is too difficult for them to overcome. They are years behind in tech from Waymo/Cruise. I wouldn't bet on it, but I have a feeling they will not survive."", ""The assumption that SDC applied on ride hailing is not a disruptive innovation, I think is too quickly said. Uber and Lyft offer nothing special but a car with a driver for point A to B.\nSo why a new player with a tech that offer the same service, cheaper and safer won't have a chance to beat them?"", '>Because AVs are likely to be too expensive for personal ownership, there is broad consensus that deploying them within ride-hailing networks will be, at least initially, one of the most commercially viable paths for autonomous passenger transportation.\n\nEven with the softening ""at least initially"" statements  this rings hollow to me. The premium for autonomous vehicles shouldn\'t be substantially more than the current high end cruise controls; and historically features like this drop in price.\n\nI think the interest in ride-hailing networks mirrors the transition to recurring revenue  and ""as a service"" models we\'ve seen all over the place but often in cloud computing. There are advantages to the provider because they get a constant revenue stream and there are advantages to the consumer because they don\'t need to deal with all the details. Like oil changes. \n\nI suspect the efficiencies shake loose a bunch of value for everybody involved. This is a win for society as a whole. Its not as efficient as good public transportation but it does help the last mile problem and also the social complication of some folks being ""too good to ride on the bus with those other people"" problems.', 'Very interesting analysis of the strategic competitive landscape between companies like Uber, Lyft, Waymo, Cruise, Voyage, etc. Argues that Waymo and Cruise are unlikely to unseat Uber and Lyft as ride-hailing leaders and so should avoid a crazy expensive head-on battle.

What are the logistics of replacing that number or a significant fraction in a given city?

If it gets you there faster, use it. Remember if you have a working system I can replace a part of it and compare the output. So let's say my perception system depends on Lidar, if I run a second perception system and give the input to the predication and planning systems, I can see where the other parts of the system do different things. Then I can decide if the new system perceived something wrong, or did it surpass the other system. I can then focus on the delta's between systems, and improve the new system very quickly.\n\nSo imagine you have a fleet of L4 cars but they are so expensive they can't be run profitably. That is awesome, because you have data. That data can be used to make your system less expensive, and perform increasingly better. \n\nI would use more crutches if we have them. Like lifting the car so it rides higher up, and can avoid more obstacles on the road. Armoring the car so it has even better crash protection.

There’s very little reviews or literature on how these systems work. Most that I’ve test driven are not very clear about when they are actively steering for you.

It's actually pretty close. Here’s an in depth review from a Tesla owner. DRIVING ASSIST

I recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride ""S"" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.

Coming from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the /u/thestraightpipes review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the ""best lane keep of any car they've driven this year"", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.

The two features I'm specifically interested in are the ""Lane Following Assist (LFA)"" and the ""Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)"". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.

THE SYSTEM IN USE

After enabling Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the ""Lane Following Assist"" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control. It even surprised me several times by being available on roads I would have never guessed it would work on. Roads that I know Autopilot would be available on, but anyone else's system, not so much (I'm looking at you Nissan Pro Pilot Assist).

Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" works best on perfectly straight, flat roads. This is the environment where confidence in the system is VERY high. It's when you get into one or both of the following circumstances that confidence in the system begins to erode; sharper curves, or shallower curves but at high speeds. At moderate highway speeds 55-65mph most shallow curves are handled well, but often the car would drift over the outer lane line. The system would stay engaged and not give up entirely, EVENTUALLY bringing me back slowly into the lane and near the center. The other circumstance is when road curve at higher speeds. In testing shallow curves at 75-80mph, the ""Lane Following Assist"" system would often give up entirely, turning the steering wheel icon from green to white without notice and I'd have to grip the wheel and turn myself back into the lane. 

In those circumstances the ""Lane Following Assist"" is more of a suggestion of help rather than the great confidence you get with Tesla's autopilot. With Autopilot you can really ""tune out"" and relax to a much greater degree. With the Kia system, it's helping to keep me steered in the center of the lane, but I really REALLY need to keep paying absolute attention. Yet, there were times I kept my hand gripped and at the ready when taking sharper curves on highway ramps and interchanges and the ""Lane Following Assist"" would slow down and turn into the sharper curves in a very surprisingly confident way. I just really never quite knew what to expect it to handle. Most likely after living with the Kia in daily driving for a while I'd start to really know how it works and what it's limitations are. The same happens to a lot of Autopilot users. At first they're frightened of letting go of the wheel. After using it for a year or two, you start to intimately understand it's limitations and strengths and trust it a lot more.

As far as knowing when the system is engaged and assisting with steering, it's a bit hard to tell. With Autopilot, is very obvious when jesus has taken the wheel. Two pulls on the stalk and you hear the ""bong boom"" chime. When the system turns off, you hear the ""boom bong"" chime. It's very obvious when you're engaging or disengaging the Autopilot system, and visually is very easy to see that it's active on the dashboard screen. With the Kia, the only way to know the steering is being assisted at all is when you feel a slight torque on the wheel while driving, and look down to see the steering wheel icon has turned from white to green. I was really never quite sure when it was active and going to help, or not help, without looking down at the dashboard and taking my eyes off the road. Perhaps the heads up display offered on the top Telluride SX trim with the Prestige package would help keep my eyes closer to the road.

Changing lanes is handled differently in each car. In the Tesla, with their self driving prowess, the cars with the enhanced autopilot or full self driving package handle the lane changes for you when the autopilot system is engaged. Turning on a signal, the car handles the lane change based on the cars around it. In the Kia, when you turn on the signal, the car relies on you to then steer the car out of your lane and into the other lane while the steering assist is temporarily paused. It resumes the ""Lane Following Assist"" a few seconds later once you're centered in the new lane.


BETTER OR WORSE?

Three areas where the Kia driving assist system actually performs BETTER than Tesla's Autopilot 2 are: the smoothness of the adaptive cruise control system, when lanes on the highway momentarily widen, and the length of time you can keep your hands off the wheel. 

The adaptive cruise, perhaps by the sluggish nature of the internal combustion engine drivetrain, would accelerate and brake so much more smoothly than any Tesla system I've ever used. It's just so much less twitchy, and far more smooth. It makes for a more relaxed experience in normal use. I didn't get a chance to experience how the Kia system would react to someone cutting in close at the last second, but hopefully that's handled well by the Kia. The only downside to Kia's adaptive cruise control system is one found in almost every other car aside from a Tesla. Once you come to a stop, after a very short amount of time, you have to re-engage the cruise control by tapping the accelerator pedal. In stop and go traffic having to constantly tap the gas pedal can become quite annoying compared to the Tesla, where it can go something like 5 whole minutes at a stop before it'll disengage. Stop and go traffic with Autopilot is more relaxing in this way.

Another area where the Kia system performed better than Tesla's Autopilot 2 is when lanes would momentarily widen, such as when driving in the far right lane going past an on ramp. In these locations, the road widens slightly and the Autopilot 2 system moves over to the right to remain in the middle of the wider lane, for each and everyone one of these you drive past. To anyone coming onto the on ramp it might appear you're trying to block them out. The Kia system performs much like how Tesla's Autopilot 1 system worked, which was a collaboration between Mobile Eye's camera+chip system, and Tesla's own software. In these circumstances the Kia and the Autopilot 1 system would keep the car steered straight, staying to the left of the momentarily widened lane. It's more like how a person would drive and far more natural. There were also a few moments in my experience with the Kia when the right lane line would be hard to make out or visually non existent, and the Kia system remained engaged confidently. There were also a few times when lane lines would be hard to make out at all on the freeway and the Kia system remained engaged like Autopilot would. Impressed!

The last area where the Kia system is better is, as pointed out in the Straight Pipes review, you can keep your hands off the steering wheel for a shockingly long amount of time in ideal conditions. Slow or stop-and-go traffic on long roads and highways is where Kia's system really shines, should you want to keep your hands off the wheel. Autopilot is very adamant about keeping your hand on the wheel, providing just a little bit of weight on one side or the other. It varies depending on your speed, but taking your hands off the Tesla steering wheel for more than around 10 seconds, the car would prompt you to put your hands back on. Nissan's Pro Pilot Assist is even worse in my experience. I didn't push the time limits of the Kia system, but it allowed for more hands off time that I personally would ever need, such as taking a two-handed sip of water from a water bottle, or grabbing a napkin from the glove box.

One thing I didn't get a chance to test was Kia's ""Highway Driving Assistant (HDA)"". It's found in the upper trim levels of the Telluride and from what I understand it uses the GPS/navigation system data just like Tesla's autopilot to know the speed limit of the road you're on and will adjust your cruise control speed to match the changes in speed limits. Though I like this feature in the Tesla, I've also found it to be limiting on some country back roads and farm roads where you want to be driving maybe a little over the speed limit to keep with the flow of traffic and not be holding anyone back. Autopilot will only ever let you go 5mph over the limit of the road you're on and sometimes that's annoying on those kinds of roads. Flat, wide open, no pedestrians around, and most people driving in front and behind driving 10mph over the limit. Perfect conditions for autopilot to keep the monotony of that road at bay, yet I won't use it because it limits my speed more than I'd like.

Another condition I didn't get to experience in the Kia was stopped car detection. In Tesla's case, a few high profile incidents have occurred involving semi trucks or fire trucks stopped on the highway and the car did not detect the stationary object. This is something that ALL cars from ALL manufacturers with radar+camera systems struggle with. You're approaching at high speed and the car in front of you suddenly moves over and you're faced with a stopped vehicle or object. Does the car react in time? The Tesla does an ok job MOST of the time.


IN CONCLUSION

The key feeling I get here with the Kia system, and even some of my experiences with Nissan's Pro Pilot, is inconsistency. I can never quite tell, at least in my short 24 hours with the Kia system, when it's going to give up on me or when it's going to push through and really provide steering assist I can rely on. Tesla's autopilot is still the gold standard in reducing the stress load on the driver on the highway, really providing a strong sense of confidence and predictability that most other systems are still lacking. I haven't tried BMW's new system found in their updated 3 series and X5, but this is the closest anyone's gotten to Autopilot and it works well enough that should I ever want the very excellent Kia Telluride or Hyundai Palisade, I'd feel VERY at home in Los Angeles traffic with their system.

Imagine the quality of the highway driving today if they had done that, probably saving non-negligible amounts of lives, gas, and money along the way. They also could've continued to develop or build out full self-driving at the same time, while learning a lot from their highway miles.\n\n 🤷"", "">Would Waymo be further along with 6 years of a commercial highway project?\n\nIf they deployed a commercial highway pilot, I don't see how that would expedite their urban L4 autonomy much.\n\n>Would the industry be further along?\n\nI am not sure what you are getting at.\nOne thing, I suppose if Waymo partnered with one OEM and offered a really really good consumer highway pilot.  (better than any that are out there now)... Would this have pushed other OEMs to develop competing systems more?  I'm not sure, that it would have.\n\n>Would there have actually been less accidents on the road?\n\nWell, atleast the vehicles with the Waymo hihgway pilot would have fewer accidents yet"", 'I think Google/Waymo made the correct  business decision to skip autopilot and focus on urban L4 driving for sure.\n\nThat said, I don’t see anything wrong with highway pilot, driver assist systems.  They reduce accidents and save lives. \n\nI think now all major OEMs have a basic L2 systems now, and these systems all increase highway safety.  And almost all OEMs will be launching in the near future more advanced L2 systems that allow hands free driving and many other features, these systems also increase highway safety.\n\nAlthough, I am frustrated with ADAS... because it miseducated and misleads the public about self driving cars.  ADAS is and will continue to educate consumers about the limitations of ADAS.  However, most consumers do not realize how different ADAS and SDCs are. And furthermore limitations of ADAS make media headlines and hysteria which also hurts SDC industry.  So it’s very frustrating.... though... currently ADAS reduces more accidents and saves way more lives than SDCs do... and it will probably continue to be this way for the next several years and maybe even 10 years.', ""The truth is, a highway autopilot is boring.  It might save some lives, so that's not boring, but it's not the brass ring, and the brass ring is what Google always goes for.\n\nThis product would be something to give time back to rich people, by letting them sleep/work/relax in the highway portion of their trips, in a car that costs $10,000 or so more than the standard car.   A decent product, but not the kind Google does.  It only makes a small number of billions."", ""Probably not. If they were ready in 2013, they would still need to develop the driver monitoring software. Then they would have had a long road to value engineering the hardware. I can't imagine them releasing a  product until at least 3 years later or 2016. Probably later than that, because OEM manufacturing and procurement process is by necessity long. \n\nRemember Super Cruise and Pro-pilot are using the EyeQ 3 hardware (Camera only) first finished in 2014. There are no cars yet using their current EyeQ4 chips, developed in 2018, and the EyeQ5 isn't out yet. \n\nSo I don't think being a mobile eye competitor would have been a good move."", ""I don't think so.  If you are targeting L4, highway driving is a late stage optimization.  You don't need it, it is comparatively easy and it is intrinsically dangerous.  On the other hand, street driving is essential, hard and comparatively safe.\n\nThe road data can come from human driven vehicles so the Streetview fleet, for example, provides a geographically broad dataset (close to 100% coverage).  On the other hand, it is probably very thin in other dimensions.  I think that Google relies heavily on simulation which is not great as assumptions in the simulation can taint the outcome."", ""The main point was that Level 2 systems make humans complacent. It doesn't matter how many lives Tesla's tech has saved. The goal is to reduce those deaths, not add to it. Waymo had the foresight to realize ADAS is not the way to go. OEMs can likely very easily replicate lvl 2 systems like Tesla, BUT, they don't want to because OEMs have more to lose than Tesla currently."", '>Fast forward 6 years and Waymo is only doing a handful of miles truly driverless.\n\nJust wondering, since I\'ve read this in another thread as well - what is the source for this?  Last time I read something about Waymo, they talked about needing the safety driver mostly for parking lots and ""stopping at the right location"" for the customer.', '> The impact on lives saved and safety from Waymo isn\'t much. The income from the company is certainly small compared to their potential.\n\nDid you ever come across the term ""moonshot project""? Google internally called the SDC project a ""moonshot project"" because it resembles some of the unique conditions and dangers NASA had to deal with back in the days of Apollo. Gene Krantz, flight director of the Apollo missions,  put it together in one sentence: ""Failure is not an option."" It takes time to do it right, but if they suceed, the impact on lives saved (and many many other aspects of daily life that interfere with traffic) will change dramatically. (and perhaps cash flow, too ;-).', 'My model3 does off ramps with great ease. The on ramps are the problem for me in autopilot.', 'They were wrong plain and simple and i called this years ago. Google is bad at bring first with innovative consumer products. Supercruise proved in 2016 that driver monitoring camera basically solves the un-attentive issues. The exact same issues Google mentioned. For a tech company they are so short-sighted.', '[deleted]', 'Tesla has way more cars on the road with Autopilot than Nissan and Cadillac. Hard to know if the eyes thing is the problem or just the probabilty.', ""While I don't have any special insight, I kind of get the feeling that Waymo's strategy is to sit on their tech and improve it until there is a competitor ready to enter the market, then stomp them with it.""]","With hindsight, was Waymo wrong to scrub on ramp to off ramp ""autopilot"" in 2013? In 2013 Waymo was getting ready to launch their on ramp to off ramp ""autopilot"" project. After internally testing it with employees and seeing the employees not pay attention and even fall asleep, they decided that incremental progress wouldn't work. The hand off problem was too hard. Removing the driver from the loop would be the only option for them.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 6 years and Waymo is only doing a handful of miles truly driverless. The impact on lives saved and safety from Waymo isn't much. The income from the company is certainly small compared to their potential.

&#x200B;

Driver assistance system like Cadillac's and Nissan's that watch the driver's eyes have had little in the way of bad press or accidents. Systems like Tesla that do not even watch the driver's eyes have certainly had bad press, but it's possible they have even stopped more accidents than they've caused. It's certainly not the safety nightmare that Waymo envisioned that caused them to pivot in 2013.

&#x200B;

Would Waymo be further along with 6 years of a commercial highway project? Perhaps long haul trucking would be scaling by now?

Would there have actually been less accidents on the road?

Would the industry be further along?

However, you can take a portion of your taxis down from 10am to 11:30 and 1:30 to 3 for some partial recharging -- at daytime rates.   \n\nIn the future, with massive solar installs, those daytime rates might be much more interesting.\n\nHaving a full day pack uses more room and weight than a half-day pack, but the cost seems to be less than I initially thought, so full day packs will rule.', 'This would be great for Powerwalls and manned cars too.\n\nSo the battery is not specific to driverless cars.', 'This article keeps re charging like the battery.

Nikon has spent hundreds of millions in research and development to get their cameras where they are. They spend a lot of promotional money (big money) to keep that brand recognizable.\n\n>So someone like Sugarman comes along and says, how can I make money off Nikon? So he finds a competent Japanese company that can make an excellent camera, but without a well known name. He checks it out. It is pretty good. Maybe not quite Nikon, but a good value. So he puts some new name on the product, and then he takes out full page ads that read something like this:\n\n>JS&A XD7500 camera offers Nikon $5 million if Nikon D7500 can beat the JS&A XD7500 in a fair contest\n\n>The ad features a picture of the camera, and a picture of the $5 million check. It also spells out that there will be a variety of models and scenery that represent normal photographic and lighting conditions. It will also suggest a panel of judges from photographic societies and magazines.\n\n>This game has been played again and again with audiophile equipment, radar detectors, fast cars, tires, you name it. The number of times that the big name has taken the bait is exactly zero.\n\n>Here’s what happens. The challenge is never answered. The knock-off product gets a big jump in sales because it looks like the big name is afraid of the challenger.\n\n>Here’s why no one takes the challenge: Even being in the same contest with the challenger gives some credibility to the challenger. Even if the big name accepted the challenge, JS&A only loses a check but still gets publicity for it. If by some chance the big name took the challenge, what would happen? The scoring has been set up so that scores will be close. The big product gets a score of 95 and the challenger gets a score of 91. At that point a lot of people will say: “I don’t have $2000 for the Nikon, but at $800, the JS&A is almost as good.” The challenger still does not lose.

It made me wonder if there would be a way to make racing safer by employing AI to monitor the track position of all cars and foresee situations such as this one and make the cars take suitable evasive action without the drivers' inputs. 

[Here is a good video to show what happened this weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznYP6_fv5U)

An active AI monitoring the race should be able to detect that Hubert's car is about to be T-boned by another driver at 180mph. If it could interfere therefore, it might be able to brake the other car and take over steering inputs and also brake the cars behind. 

I can't think of any programming issues that haven't been solved yet and I think that the closed circuit and expected behavior of the cars should reduce the variables that the system has to consider.

People on this forum love to talk about things like ghost traffic jams and how SDCs will fix that. Correct. But in the city, the only issue is space. A block holds 20 cars. SDC or not, the math doesn\'t change on that. They all have to sit there and wait for the light to change, and repeat this every block. \n\nAnother SDC fantasy is that we don\'t need traffic lights. Except in places like NYC, there are more pedestrians every block than cars. \n\nNow, self driving does have the potential to massively improve public transit by drastically lowering the cost of running fixed vehicles like buses or trains. You see this in places like Paris, where they converted a metro line to self driving and theres a train every 2 minutes.\n\n...but this wont happen in NYC because of the powerful transit union. There is a ""shuttle"" that runs between Times Square and Grand Central. Just back and forth, two stations. No crossing tracks, no intersections, just straight back and forth.

A single L-train carries 2,000 people. The L train is 'self-driving' (CBTC & ATO) and they move as close together as they can while maintaining safe braking distance. The trains all talk to each other & control computers to make this possible. Currently 24 trains per hour each direction (1-2 minute headways during rush hour), with more coming once they add a new substation.\n\nThe size of the chassis of vehicles makes it impossible to fit this many people on the road at once. You could MAYBE fit this many people into buses, but even then, buses are lower capacity than rail cars. On top of that, you have to deal with crossing traffic, which includes cyclists and pedestrians at very high volumes -- in essence, a high-speed full auto intersection is not possible along 14th St, which the L runs under.\n\nThere's not a way to make the napkin math work here. I could see some lower capacity areas become self-driving mini buses -- 34th St would be a good case for this, as it currently has a full-size high-headway bus. Low headway, smaller buses would make sense here.\n\nOtherwise, no, I don't see rail going anywhere once you reach scale."", ""Short term, total cluster f.\nLong term, I think we'll see all of it transformed.\n\nMass transit will look more like dedicated lane self driving busses or small set of train cars.

If that means everything other street in a city is HOV, I expect it to happen.

So we can quadruple capacity to say 5 people without adding traffic. Maybe even more capacity with bigger vehicles. Plus traffic goes down from all the automated better driving. \n\nWhen you buy your mobility plan from Waymo/uber, the cheapest plans will include scheduled pick up for work in cars with 5+people, that still bring you door to door. They may bring you to a subway from your door if that is the fastest way to get you downtown. But it'll be timed, and a car will be waiting to pick you up at the other end. \n\nIf you want a fancier plan, you can pay for on demand single rider cars even during rush hour. It will be extra.

I imagine a minibus type thing, but with a front, middle, and rear compartment. that way, you would get riders who don\'t want to share transit with strangers (women often don\'t feel comfortable on public transit) which would pull more people out of cars and take up less road space, reducing traffic.', 'No mention of cycleways? \n\n50% of the trips in Vancouver, Canada are done without a car:\n\n[Vox - In Vancouver, 50% of trips are by foot, bike, or transit.](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/9/13897078/walkable-vancouver-video)\n\nIn Copenhagen and Amsterdam, most trips are bicycle rides.

Mass transit vs self-driving taxis I stumbled upon an interesting (read: contentious) discussion in another political sub about governments building mass-transit (mostly rail/light rail). Self-driving taxis were brought up and, wow, tensions heightened...

Are self-driving taxis going to make urban rail systems obsolete for getting around major cities? 

I see some pros/cons for both sides but not a lot of studied comparisons and few calm/patient discussions on the topic. 

Here's some highlights to illustrate the acid thrown my way for simply asking about comparing self-driving taxis with the future of light rail for getting around cities:

""No. Self-driving taxis are a likely evolution of *taxis*, but though beloved of the usual libertarian-dimwit brigade, they are an insanely horrible solution to the general problem of transportation in cities.""

""Self-driving cars save on labor costs, but they only offer more of the same clusterfuck as any system based on large single-person vehicles (see: any American city).

They use tons of space, they drive development towards lower density, they essentially fuck up your city, and not just temporarily, they screw up the entire *structure* of the city; digging yourself out of the POV hole is an enormously difficult and lengthy process.""

""The light rail would be much more eco-friendly. There are also a ton of commuters who won't use a self driving car.""

""a horde of self-driving taxis would actually be extremely wasteful and crowded. For example, with a lack of space and parking, they would have to continue driving around on streets 24/7, all night, even with no passengers.

More waste, more congestion. A well-built public (mass-)transportation system will always be superior. In general, well-built public systems are more efficient than their alternatives.""

are we really just a bunch of 'libertarian-dimwits' here? I can't wrap my head around a city like NYC experiencing MORE congestion from a fleet of autonomous vehicles which gum up traffic a lot LESS than human-driven taxis and I can't see small electric vehicles being more ""wasteful"" than giant elevated/dug-in train/bus networks with giant platforms (which typically run way under-capacity.)

You need to divide, group, and prioritize these problems. Obviously, the biggest divide is between problems you can launch with and problems you can't. Anything grouped into safety is clearly in the later category, However, from the reporting these seemed like a minority, parking and drop off issues can be improved after launch. \n\nIf you get a safety issue, you need to look at the ride data, see how it played out, did the driver take control, should they have, was it really a safety problem, or was  perception of safety the problem. Perhaps the car reacted well but the human didn't like it, perhaps the car should have reacted differently, even if it avoided the problem. You can't assume there is an issue just because one was reported. \n\nIf there are 30% of riders having problems, and only a minority are having safety problems, and only some of those  problems are real. The article might be right. \n\nTwo corollaries from this. First the difference between SF and AZ are really instructive about how well Waymo does in more complex environments. \n\nSecond, no one is testing at Waymo's scale, and that the data they are getting from customers is really important and actionable. If your company isn't testing at this scale and collecting that data, you are really far from having a product. Waymo is creating the business processes necessary to run a service like this, they are creating the pipeline to solve problems at scale. The next step for Waymo will be to operate a mixed service, sometimes giving people a car with no backup, and other times using a backup driver. They will use software to super-geo-fence the no back up drivers. Very restricted routes and times, but they will grow that area, and scale the service.  When the mixed service generates enough revenue to cover marginal costs, they'll open a service in a second city. At that point we are in a value engineering phase. Each improvement to the software makes it more autonomous and cheaper to run, each improvement that makes hardware cheaper to build and operate makes things more profitable.  That's when you'll see major expansion."", 'It\'s going to be a long process. People will complain about anything because that\'s we we\'re good at. Think about how far they\'ve come as a company. Also it\'s important to note that people probably felt the same way when transitioning from horses to cars. Now, the transition is from human to robot. There will hurdles, but I think there will eventually be a tipping point where people get into an SDC and say, ""Meh, I\'m at my destination.""', 'I wonder if Waymo will make any comment or consider releasing the data (lol).', ""Efrati's such a hack."", ""I agree - it's very impressive. But it's hard to take the author seriously when he includes things like:\n\n>Some of the problems will be easily tolerated in a service that's half the price of Uber (and eventually less).  \n\nWhen every study I've seen suggests that the driver is only a small part of the service cost (like \\~ 15%). \n\n> The saving factor is that teams don't improve at a linear pace. As they get more experienced, they get better at getting better. If it takes 2 years to get from 99.9% to 99.99%, it might well take only another two years to get to 99.999% and another 2 to get to 99.9999%.

Cities, especially big cities, real estate in downtown comes at an extreme premium.  Real estate being used for parking is a sub optimal use of space.  Communities like San Francisco, housing costs well over $1000 per square foot and having a 900 square foot garage is NOT having $900k of more living space.    \n\n\nTall residential buildings are also dependent on parking.  If you want to build an 70 floor sky scraper in Los Angeles, it may house 1300 people, which would mean today it would need 1300 parking spaces nearby.  So the project may be a total no-go right now because the parking jacks up the cost and people will not pay the premium prices if they can not park at home.  This parking requirement is a major restriction on building dense housing.   But if parking was replaced with a loading/unloading system for SDC cars these mega residential towers now become viable and can actually be placed relatively close to each other with parks in between them.   This could also juice up the ridership on existing grade separated mass transit.   Not in the 2020s, but I can see the 2030s a lot of cities completely razing mid density blocks and replacing them with mega towers and allowing population density to go up 10 fold.  At these population densities things like monorails and expanding the subway system become much more viable and much more politically popular.    \n\n\nAccording to Tony Seba, the amount of land used in Los Angeles for parking is the equivalent to 3 San Franciscos.  This means that if the parking lots in Los Angeles were repurposed to urban development the city could house 3 million additional people.  This could also allow for more green space, more mixed use space.  Greater pedestrian areas.  I actually think a lot of streets will become pedestrian malls vs car traffic.  City planners can figure out some effective way to minimize the roads car use while optimizing their pickup/drop off points and enabling a much faster flow of traffic.   People actually like really cool pedestrian zones.  Its why people pay a lot of money to go to Disneyland.  We are social animal and we like the idea of going downstairs and then walking around, seeing people, and doing enjoyable activities.  I can also envision major cities having separate pedestrian bridges in downtown areas so the people and cars never cross.    \n\n\n  \nHow will this affect commuters?  People typically hate shitty commutes.  A shitty commute means you have to wake up an hour or more earlier.  A shitty commute means you 'work' 470 hours a year that you don't get paid extra.  A shitty commute means you spend money to get to work.   Being far removed from the urban area, your shitty commute may also mean that you live far away from other amenities.  The good restaurants may also be an hour away.  The cool parks may be an hour away.  Your friends may be an hour away.   The good doctors may be an hour away.   There are many other advantages to living in the city other than a shorter commute time.   Look at cities like San Francisco and New York.  Some people want to commute to those cities for work, but people also want to live in those cities."", ""There's something called the [Marchetti's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant).\n\nIt states that, despite improving transportation technology, most people spend up to 1 hour commuting and that hasn't changed since prehistoric times."", 'I don’t think 4 hour commutes will ever be the norm. Even when people don’t need to drive (ex. Public transport, chauffeurs) they tend to avoid overly long trips. There could be nonetheless a slight inclination towards people tolerating longer commutes though, but not to the extent of 4 hours being normal.', ""My opinion is no. Look at areas where you can currently commute by rail or bus. In effect, these are self-driving cars as far as the user is concerned. But people still want to live closer to work. Why? Well, sleep for one, but also, time in a commute is not the same quality time spent elsewhere. Just like how sleeping on an airplane isn't fantastic, nor working on one. I reject the idea that people will treat time in their commute as expendable and live further as a result. It's just not supported by current similar scenarios."", 'I travel all over the country for work. Sometimes, I\'m lucky enough to get a commutable gig. Unfortunately, spending 5 hours a day on 8 trains was one such ""commutable"" gig. Right now, I\'m traveling 4 hours each way on Mondays and Thursdays and that doesn\'t change whether I\'m flying or driving.\n\nI decided to get out of airports this year and instead bought a car specifically to use OpenPilot. It has made me think about things like converting a Toyota Sienna into a self-driving mobile executive office and finding someone to be the safety driver vs. a traditional chauffeur.\n\nI don\'t need to pay for my own travel to work far from home, but I\'ve known people who aren\'t that lucky. What are the chances I could find a working professional looking for a cheap ride to DC each week? What if they offered to help with gas and tolls? How would they react if I said, ""Surprise! You get to drive! It\'s not that bad, though, the car basically drives itself. Oh, and I\'ll be chilling out in the back."" I would drive myself for my 10-minute commute during the week and pick up my driver on the way home at the end of the week. \n\nWhile that arrangement piques my interest, it seems like something I\'d want to wrap up in an LLC for legal protections. My point is there may be interesting ways to close the gaps in self-driving technology while the technology continues to develop.', ""I used to work in the SF Bay Area and take the commuter shuttles. I was able to work pretty effectively on the shuttle ride which made the time spent a bit more acceptable.\n\nPut someone in a super comfy private self driving car, I could imagine spending 3 hours driving and working on the way to the office, do a couple hours' face to face meetings in the office, driving 3 hours home. Not ideal but then you could be living on the shores of Tahoe and working in the Bay Area!"", ""Some things will happen once the shared self driving cars are unleashed..\n\n* existing parking structures can be converted to more useable living space. \n* existing  residential garages can be converted to another bedroom. \n* workers will be willing to endure longer commutes since they are no longer burdened with the meaningless task of driving. Commuters can read, eat, nap, study. A one hour commute will be trivial if I can use it as wind down time. \n* real estate prices should plummet since there is more available housing from the converted parking spaces. \n* Commuters will purchase larger homes with land further away from their jobs. \n\nWe will have both more sprawl and more density!\n\nExciting times. I can't wait to see what actually happens."", ""I think it will depend heavily on where you are and where you work. certainly, peoples' tolerance longer commutes will go up, since it won't be as tedious. however, if lots of people start moving farther out, it will increase traffic significantly, and take even longer. on the other hand, it may entice more people to live in cities. one of the worst aspects of living in cities is dealing with cars. you're going to get dents, your insurance is higher, parking sucks, etc.. if taking a self-driving taxi becomes just a little bit cheaper, it will make more sense to use that instead of driving yourself. then, parking can be turned into green space, traffic will get calmer (\\~40% of traffic in cities is from people looking for parking), pollution will decease (electric cars likey), so you then get a situation where a lot of people move closer to where they work because it becomes easier/nicer to live there without a car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work outside of a large city, and the people who don't live in the city cite parking as the #1 reason they don't live within the city (crime being #2). that's just an anecdote, but I think it's representative of how a lot of people view living in cities.""]","Self driving car and housing How would self driving change the way people commute?

Sure, someone could develop a cyptographically secure infrastructure to do so, but could small municipalities execute on it?\n\nStop lights are easy.', ""Do you mean street lights or traffic lights?  We'll still have both.   We'll still have lots of pedestrians, cyclists and human drivers on the roads, and they need both of those."", ""independent traffic control is probably still a good idea. it's also unlikely to have all humans off the road in the foreseeable future, though I suppose there could be some streets that are autonomous-only. even still, I think a roundabout would move cars roughly the same volume as a dynamically negotiated system."", 'I remain dubious of the synchronized intersection as I have seen it described.  \n\nThe obvious problem is you can\'t have manual cars.  In order for them to be even remotely viable, most cars would have to be autonomous.  Even then, even a small number of manual cars will cause havoc with the system and defeat the purpose of it completely.  It wwould be like having police running around with their lights on all the time and snarling up the intersections.  If such intersections were implemented, public pressure would kill off all manual cars quickly out of spite if nothing else.\n\nSo lets say everything is autonomous.  Next comes the concept of bandwidth Vs. latency.  The same way engineers say fast, cheap, good; pick two.  You can either optimize for bandwidth or latency.  Today cars and intersections have no hope of optimizing for latency so they choose bandwidth and push as many cars through as possible and only keep latency down to the point that drivers don\'t start running red lights out of frustration.  When most people think of synchronous intersections, they think of cars flowing smoothly by from all directions perfectly timed to slide through the gaps and not hitting anyone.  \n\nThis is possible, but only if the roads making up the intersections are lightly used.  At a certain amount of traffic, a synchronous intersection needs to convert to something much closer to what a policeman would do if they were running the intersection.  This optimizes for bandwidth.  In the end, if you use an intelligent controller even in the low usage situation, you have the same effect as a syncronous intersection, but one that can also be used by manual cars.\n\nI\'m not saying put a policeman on a box in the middle of each intersection.  I\'m suggesting updating the light controller to once that can ""see"" the traffic and direct traffic through the intersection intelligently.  Let the cars be aware of all the other cars on the road and they can plan their arrival at the intersection in such a way that the intelligent control will be able to let them through.  This is uncoordinated cooperation between the car and the light controller so there are no security concerns.  The car knows that if they go 35mph until the intersection, they will be the only car at the intersection at the time and the light controller will be green for them since why wouldn\'t it given the state of the intersection.  Even if there were rouge manual cars, the wait would be minimal.', 'We already have roads with no street lights not reachable for humans. They are called highways :-)', 'I think the ramifications for city planning are immense and underappreciated.\n\nSo much traffic is borne out of how primitive our observation, communication, and cooperation abilities are when driving cars. SDCs will essentially be part of a ""telepathic network"" of intent planning and coordination, freed from the tragedies of ""one-off interactions"" (in game theory terms) that humans find ourselves in.\n\nWe\'ll be able to return huge swathes of our downtown cores to pedestrian streets while still enjoying liberation from traffic. Lane quantity can be reduced and redundancy eliminated. It\'s going to be majestic.', 'Oops I said street lights instead of stop lights.', 'Street lights are actually mostly for humans (walking, biking, etc.).']",Serious question about future self driving cars and city infrastructure. Assuming we follow the trend towards total vehicular autonomy within the next 10 - 15 years. Would there still be a need for street lights? Or would our infrastructure change to suit autonomy. i.e. no need for street lights but rather an integrated communication system that synchronizes cars to easily avoid and wait for an opening.,6,72,9,"[2, 4, 3, 3, 22, 2, 6, 1, 2]","[30, 68, 38, 58, 468, 20, 110, 10, 16]",5.0,90.88888888888887,"{'cars': [0.0, 2], 'question': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'self': [0.0, 1], 'city infrastructure': [0.0, 1], 'communication system': [0.20000000298023224, 1], 'trend': [0.0, 1], 'need': [0.0, 2], 'autonomy': [0.30000001192092896, 2], 'street lights': [0.0, 2], 'infrastructure change': [0.0, 1], 'opening': [0.0, 1]}","{'roads': [0.20000000298023224, 4], 'controller': [0.800000011920929, 4], 'cars': [-0.10000000149011612, 14], 'problem': [0.0, 2], 'communication system': [0.10000000149011612, 1], 'lights': [0.0, 11], 'Pedestrians': [0.0, 1], 'someone': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'humans': [0.20000000298023224, 5], 'streets': [0.10000000149011612, 2], 'street lights': [-0.10000000149011612, 4], 'Stop lights': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'system.': [0.0, 1], 'police': [0.0, 3], 'intersections': [-0.800000011920929, 5], 'pedestrians': [0.20000000298023224, 1], 'latency': [0.0, 4], 'tunnels': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'need': [-0.30000001192092896, 4], 'opening': [0.0, 1], 'thing': [-0.20000000298023224, 4], 'type': [0.0, 1], 'drivers': [-0.4000000059604645, 2], 'municipalities': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'infrastructure': [0.5, 1], 'one': [-0.20000000298023224, 4], 'intersection': [-0.20000000298023224, 15], 'traffic lights': [0.0, 1], 'traffic control': [0.5, 1], 'number': [-0.699999988079071, 1], 'road': [0.0, 6], 'idea': [0.8999999761581421, 1], 'syncronous intersection': [0.0, 1], 'human drivers': [0.20000000298023224, 1], 'both': [0.0, 2], 'cooperation': [-0.5, 2], 'bandwidth': [-0.30000001192092896, 4], 'cyclists': [0.30000001192092896, 1], 'roundabout': [0.0, 1], 'volume': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'lots': [0.30000001192092896, 1], 'traffic': [-0.10000000149011612, 7], 'system': [-0.4000000059604645, 3], 'everything': [0.699999988079071, 1], 'purpose': [-0.8999999761581421, 1], 'policeman': [-0.20000000298023224, 2], 'concept': [0.0, 1], 'car': [0.0, 17], 'people': [0.0, 1], 'something': [0.0, 1], 'pressure': [-0.4000000059604645, 1], 'point': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'frustration': [-0.8999999761581421, 1], 'directions': [0.0, 1], 'gaps': [-0.6000000238418579, 1], 'order': [0.0, 1], 'havoc': [-0.8999999761581421, 1], 'nothing': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'spite': [-0.6000000238418579, 1], 'hope': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'interactions': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'amount': [0.0, 1], 'end': [-0.10000000149011612, 2], 'usage situation': [0.0, 1], 'anyone': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'effect': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'Street lights': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'SDCs': [0.0, 1], 'highways': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'city planning': [0.4000000059604645, 1], 'communication': [0.0, 2], 'Next': [0.0, 1], 'pedestrian streets': [0.0, 1], 'wait': [-0.30000001192092896, 2], 'cooperation abilities': [0.30000001192092896, 1], 'ramifications': [0.0, 1], 'observation': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'part': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'control': [0.8999999761581421, 6], 'planning': [-0.20000000298023224, 2], 'state': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'game theory terms': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'tragedies': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'network': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'coordination': [-0.4000000059604645, 1], 'downtown cores': [0.0, 1], 'quantity': [0.10000000149011612, 1], 'redundancy': [0.0, 1], 'biking': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'walking': [0.0, 1], 'liberation': [0.800000011920929, 1], 'engineers': [0.10000000149011612, 1], 'way': [0.20000000298023224, 3], 'security concerns': [-0.30000001192092896, 1], 'swathes': [0.0, 1], 'middle': [-0.10000000149011612, 1], 'box': [-0.20000000298023224, 1], 'arrival': [0.10000000149011612, 1]}"

Waymo will have to get more involved in the design of vehicles if they perfect their driver. This is part of running a successful service, or a portfolio of successful services, as is most likely. How they organize to accomplish that, just isn't too important. The right choice just may not be obvious right now. \n\nLikely guess is google will be buying skateboards (Battery, drive train and tires, maybe frames) and outfitting them with bodies and interiors and sensors. No reason to design and build drive trains, lots of reasons to design interiors and exteriors. There is also a bunch of regulatory work needed to make this happen.  Probably lots of safety standards will go a way if SDC are safe enough. Skateboards can be designed for easy repair and refresh.\n\nSDC's will have a number of uses, and require many different shapes and sizes.

Dark, but true.', '[deleted]', ""Segregation. The 'haves' will be able to commute between pockets of affluence without the bother of hiring a 'have not' driver or seeing the 'have not' neighborhoods in between."", 'Roads will get more congested because even though there will be less accidents, more people will be driving because of the extra convenience.', ""Car ownership for low income people can be a massive economic drain and a source of considerable economic anxiety.  The car they need to own so they can go to work can cost them randomly a few thousand bucks should something go wrong.   TAAS will enable the lowest income people in society to have the same high quality transportation that NEW car ownership would offer them at a drastically lower, and predictable rate.   They will not need to save money to buy some used bucket of bolts or have to go into debt to fix their car.     Its pretty fucked when a person has to use 3-4 paychecks to fix their car and 2-3 paychecks to fuel it, and 2 paychecks to insure it.  For a low income person car ownership is a massive liability, but one they have to take on to get to their job.   For people who can't afford the car in the first place, finding work is drastically harder and the options they have at hand are typically not very great.   Many lower income folks in cities can't justify paying for parking in their own neighborhood and with this technology they will not have to.    Uber as is already goes 5x-6x as fast as the bus from door to door, and this does not take into consideration odd bus timing (such as the bus dropping you off at work 15 minutes after your boss wants you at work, resulting in you taking an earlier buss and waiting around for 45 minutes before you start) and if you have to take multiple buses Uber much faster than 6x as fast.   In 2005 I used to had to take two buses from my house to a college campus to take a course I needed (the college I normally attended was 1 mile from my house, in a neighborhood I grew up in).  This two bus system resulted in a 2 hour trip from my house to the classroom,  a trip which is normally a 20 minute drive.   Imagine if that was work, and an employee had leave 140 minutes early to get to work on time.   It also turned a 2 hour class into an all day 6+ hour ordeal.  And if I had to stay late to do something I would have to sit and wait for another hour for the next bus.   The daily pass was also $5 per day (I only needed it twice a week)  \n\n\nFor people in food deserts, or far removed from commercial, social, educational, and health services, TAAS will allow them to get to where ever they need to be at a drastically cheaper cost than any alternative.   Even if the government pays some monthly amount of their TAAS budget as  welfare program this will be far more empowering than whatever limited public transportation they may currently have.   They can take a job anywhere and know with confidence they can get to work every day regardless of where the job is in their community.   They won't have to go into major debt or take on a major responsibility.    \n\n\n  \nThis service will allow rural people, people who are far removed from airports and transportation hubs to get to their longer range destination by a sleeper car showing up directly to the home at say 8pm, and then driving for 13-14 hours while the rider watches TV and sleeps to take them to their destination the following morning that is 700 miles away.   They can wake up refreshed and get anywhere they want to go.  \n\n\nBeing lost will be a thing of the past. Pretty much anywhere you are you will just summon a ride to take you home.   You can go to a city you have never been to, perhaps even a city in a foreign country where they do not even speak English, and immediately summon a ride, which communicates to you in English, and takes you exactly to where you need to be.    \n\n\nFor the United States in particular, the shift to TAAS will completely redesign our cities.   I am convinced the adoption of TAAS will be finished by 2030, but the building of buildings to accommodate this new change will still take a while.  But in some cities will happen very quickly as real estate is in an extreme pinch and during a 2 acre parking lot into a 50 floor building will make some investors a lot of money.    \n\n\n2040 will look extremely different.   American cities will look different.   There will be much more high rise buildings as parking will not be a limiting factor.  There will be much more green space within the cities.  Loading zones will be everywhere, but fleet charging will mostly be out of site.  Parking lots will mostly not exist.   Areas will become more pedestrian friendly and some places could remove roads to make a more Disney park like feel with TAAS cars in specific service areas.   2040 will look like the future.    \n\n\n  \nMost gas engine cars will end up off the road.  They may be used for private recreation on private roads and some public roads certain times of the day.  But most will end up as collector's items, or in museums to 20th and 21st Century artifacts.  Your typical ICE car will have a negative value, you will have to pay someone to take it off your hands.   It will be like getting rid of an old mattress, no one will want it.    Car maintenance and repair will still be a thing but car mechanics and their businesses as we know them will die out.   TAAS companies will have in house service or contract all their service out to specialists.  No more consumer to Mechanic relationship.  Engine mechanics will probably shrink 10 fold between now and 2030.     When the majority of people no longer own ICE cars, and I don't mean everyone, just the majority, more than half, we will see the politics change drastically regarding cars.  No longer will parking be a major political priority.  No longer will gas taxes be unpopular.  I could definitely see more cities banning ICE cars, especially older cars and diesels, from city centers (that one is already happening in Europe).    The majority of people who don't use gasoline will see no problem drastically raising a gas tax on the minority who do.  When it goes to the polls people will vote to fuck gasoline.   Driving a gas powered car 10 years from now could be a very weird thing to do and much more limiting than it is now, you could find parking in the city to be difficult and gasoline taxes making gas extremely expensive and then some places you are just now allowed to be.    \n\n\nGas stations will disappear.  Especially within the city where there will be several gas stations within a short distance of each other.  There will be a lot of issue about environmental contamination from their tanks leaking.  I know a geologist who worked in this area and he claimed it was always going to be big problem of the future.   But because the land is so valuable, it will get cleaned up and the gas stations will be repurposed into something else, in denser areas this will most likely be a tallish building with commercial services at the bottom and residential on top."", 'What reason do they have today?', 'AVs patrol themselves.

How do the cars interact with people standing in the road giving hand or flag signals? \n\nWaymo reported that they handled them back in 2016 but for something more up to date, read Brad's story posted eariler\n\n> 2. How well does the navigation handle being interrupted and sent in what may be a very non-ideal route?\n\nThis should be a non-issue.  If you have used any navigation software, it would work just like that and route like you missed a turn or something.  The only issue I see is you could force an SDC onto a route that is outside it's Geo-fence which would be a problem for sure.  As the service areas get larger this is less likely to happen.\n\nWhat is more important is that as SDCs become more common and cities start to regulate them, a lot of new possibilities open up that never existed before.  As an emergency worker, you could have the road shut down to through traffic.  This would feed into the fleet systems in real-time and they would avoid using the road if possible.  You could do this today, but it would only reach a small minority of drivers and even those would probably ignore it.  SDCs would always avoid the road."", 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/02/20/waymo-obeys-a-cop-at-broken-traffic-signal/', 'Of course, as yet no cars are deployed, so you can\'t ask ""how do?"" but rather ""how might?""   But the core answer is, ""they will do what is needed, because they can\'t deploy without this ability.""   Some teams have demonstrated abilities and understanding police officers directing traffic so work is underway.\n\nSo the first way is to try to understand the flagger\'s signals.   However, only the first car needs to do that, because it will report up to HQ that the road is closed (or other special situation) and most other unmanned cars will use different routes, unless there is no other route.\n\nThey may use data networks and get help from a remote operations center, if the flagger needs to give complex instructions.\n\nIdeally, the flagger will use an app on his or her phone to publish the location of the traffic problem and some basic facts about it.  So no unmanned car may ever encounter the flagger at all.    If there is no data signal, and nobody who has signal is aware of the problem, then it will have to wait for the first car to leave the scene to report it.\n\nIf there is a competent human in the car, they will interact with the flagger, and give some basic inputs to the car to turn around, take alternate routes etc. if there is no data.  Usually there will be data.\n\nSo the only real question is about an unmanned car in an area with no data who is the first car to come upon the flagger, and the flagger does not use any type of hand signal which is common or is used by other flaggers.  The car will know all the common hand signals on its own.   In that case, the car might just sit there until they can find somebody who knows the hand signals.', ""They will mow them down, but eventually Tesla's neural net would learn that is not okay. But the first few hundred is going to have to sacrifice for science. j/k but not really..."", '[removed]', ""None of the major players handle this right now from what we've seen. However, following social media, it seems the main players in a given area (SF+bay area at least) have been keeping in contact with their local law enforcement personnel to develop techniques to handle self driving vehicles in the future, similar to how Tesla maintains a relationship with local firefighters to offer guidance on dealing with battery fires. \n\nUltimately, I'd imagine the biggest players right now are planning on taking over remotely with a human in the scenarios you are describing, also known as tele-operation."", 'Last year, somebody (Volvo?) put out media of “pose estimation” using LiDAR. They were able to build little stick-figure skeletons of humans captured in point-clouds. Using this, they were able to parse what motions a traffic control person was making.', 'I have a Tesla Model X and it would not be able to follow instructions. But I have experienced that it will give control back to the driver if a road pattern is too difficult for it to interpret in time. This is where the driver should take over even before the car deciding anything', '[deleted]', ""The reality is that many systems on the market today can stop for stationary obstacles and people. The better ones can handle moving obstacles. But that is about as good as it gets on vehicles you could go out and buy today.\n\nAs for research and development platforms, I've seen several that can follow cone paths. However I am not aware of any systems that can take directions from emergency personnel. That would involve identifying emergency personnel and interpreting their actions. I remember that Waymo has given several talks where they mention intention recognition of pedestrians and cyclists, but that was in the context of predicting the path of said pedestrians and cyclists."", ""Since there are no real self driving cards now, they don't handle traffic flaggers at all. As far as the few that are in trials now with small areas of operations and fully 3D mapped routes, again not at all. The best you can hope for is it won't run you over while you stand in the middle of the street."", 'The short answer is they don’t. In theory they should be able to when full self driving happens. But so far no one knows when it will happen or even if it will happen or not.']","[Question] How well do self-driving cars handle traffic flaggers? I'm a firefighter and member of our fire police squad. One of my duties involves controlling traffic (e.g. flagging) at scenes of motor vehicle crashes, fires, etc. This job is incredibly frustrating and dangerous even when an attentive driver is at the wheel. Some comments I hear frequently are: ""But I have to get home,"" ""this is the route I take to work,"" ""I don't know how else to get where I'm going,"" etc. So, two-fold:

1. How do the cars interact with people standing in the road giving hand or flag signals?
2. How well does the navigation handle being interrupted and sent in what may be a very non-ideal route?

I realize this may vary greatly between manufacturers. Is this a situation manufacturers are planning for?

One prediction is that Self Driving Cars will be here tomorrow and the other prediction is other extreme that self driving cars will start to take hold several decades away.  Decades.  Not years.  Decades.    \n\n\nBoth are clearly wrong.  The early prediction folks are the easiest to disappoint because their early prediction didn\'t come true.   However, to their benefit, there has been considerable progress every year along the way.  Whatever goal we have, we are clearly getting closer to that goal.   The fact that so many players are in this space, all spending a great deal of money in solving this problem is progress.    \n\n\nThe extreme pessimists are much more difficult to disappoint.  However, their forecast of several decades away is silly.  Technological capacity increases by many orders of magnitude over decades.  My 1998 iMac had 32 megs of RAM, you get an Apple Watch now with like 768 megs of ram.  Explaining someone in 1999 that in 20 years a wrist watch will have more computational power than their desktop computer would come off as silly.   The monitor technology didn\'t exist, the hard drive didn\'t exist.    A modern desktop computer would be an absolute super computer by the standards of 20 years ago.   Everything about self driving cars is technology based and improves every year.   20 years from now computers will be a factor of 1000 times as powerful as they are today (and 100,000 times as powerful 30 years from now).    \n\n\nThis is the tech prediction I have made, and I make about most technologies.  That prediction is.  every year that goes by the investment capital into Self Driving Cars grows.  The engineering talent, the budgets, the number of companies in the space.  Every single year the capital going into this is increasing.  The result is that each year the rate or progress increases.  As the progress increases more people aware of the opportunity and invest more money into it.   This is a feedback cycle of progress, the progress in the space brings in more money which produces more progress.   This prediction is all about a constant acceleration and improvement.   But its also why there is far more money invested in 2019 than there was in 2009 and also far more progress in 2019 than there was in 2009.    \n\n\nThis nonstop progress is eventually going to hit a point where the technology works in a certain marketplace, in certain conditions, and will launch commercial service.  This commercial service will not be the end of cars, but will be the beginning of the transition.   Self Driving Cars do not have to work everywhere to work.  They just have to work in their respective marketplaces and then over time those marketplaces will grow.  It doesn\'t matter if the technology doesn\'t work in snow covered and sparsely populated Wyoming , if it works in Arizona it will launch in Arizona.  If it works in California it will launch in California.    I think we will see Arizona, Nevada, and/or California service go live at somewhere around Summer 2021/2022.  Maybe not everywhere in the states, but it will be a thing that people in these areas will use.   All eyes will definitely be on this part of the country and competitors will be racing to deliver their own technology and expand the marketplace.   I think the following years after that there will be service very quickly spreading elsewhere in the country and most likely in cities in the sunbelt.  The development will continue and the technology will continue to improve allowing the cars to better handle rain, snow, fog, and other conditions which are an issue in other parts of the country.  Voters elsewhere in America will want this technology and vote for politicians who have plans to make their roads work with it if need be.     \n\n\nI think this process will mostly be over by 2030.   There will be disruption regarding new car sales in urban/suburban markets likely within a year or two after SDC launches in those areas that will just get worse and worse every year.   We are gradually starting to see this as something like 10% of people who sell their cars don\'t buy a new one.  If that jumps up to 30% of people who sell their cars don\'t buy a new one the market will become rich with used cars and poor with new car buyers.     \n\n\nTLDR:  Progress in this sector brings on more investment into this sector, more investment produces more progress, which brings on more investment.

So it‘s maybe just a matter of time to improve the driving AI which should by then even be a better driver because it has just one task: drive safe?!\nIf the AI is good enough, there will be no need for LiDAR imho.

Roads were designed for eyes, not lasers. How can a laser see a stop signal?\n\nTo so quickly dismiss stereo vision as a resolution issue is short-sighted. Just look at how quickly megapixels in your phone attained 4K level. A single LIDAR system costs magnitudes more than a handful of cameras. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition.

It works better than AP1 for everything but stop & go traffic, and it only fails there because pre-AP tesla\'s dont have an iBooster to control the friction brakes, so our fork has to use the regenerative brakes which only slow the car down to ~6 mph.\n\nThe current model is great, steering controls (on a pre-ap tesla) is much smoother than AP1 or AP2+. If you look at a Tesla on Autopilot\'s steering wheel when doing long and sharp turns, you will see it jerk quite a lot, OP has none of that in their current model. The only issue it really has is some cars don\'t have EPAS\' with enough torque for some sharper turns. The new 2019 corolla, that is officially supported, and obviously Tesla which have the same EPAS as new teslas, have a strong enough EPAS to make every turn.\n\nWhile the current model is extremely good, it\'s based on current machine learning practices of label everything, build models, test what is produced. Not much different than every other self driving company out there, but definitely the best executed experience thus far when it comes to highway driving. hands-free perfect steering with driver monitoring just cannot be beaten. \n\nHowever... Comma has some seriously advanced ML Stuff happening internally which they want to release in the future (maybe v1.0.0?) that is similar to Tesla\'s ""Dojo"", and in that aspect are years ahead of most self driving companies. When he talks about ""laneless"" models, It\'s pure unsupervised learning with no labeling of lines or cars or anything, Similar to how alphago learns by playing against itself, the model learns from driving against 12 million miles of real drivers.\n\nKnowing the George and the Comma team, some of who are far better than George at ML, I\'m extremely confident that they will be able to pull it off too, even if they are a couple years behind Tesla in doing so.', 'He’s not an expert at ML with the long history that you’ll find at NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, but he’s well known as a capable and frank developer.

The hacking skill set is transferable and he later picked up best practices at FB and Google. He doesn’t strike me as deceptive as to the capabilities of his system. The system is in its current form a mod kit for a very limited set of newer vehicles. \n\nIf there’s a criticism of his approach is that it’s small and he hasn’t brought the full brunt of scale to the problem, which is the whole crux of modern ML.', ""I use OP daily. Here is a comment I wrote on a similar thread:\n\nI use it ~90 miles daily and LOVE it. It transforms an ~$18k Civic into a car whose driver assist features are arguably second only to Tesla for a cost of $700.\n\nLimitations: \n1.\tReally only useful on the highway, but that's on par with most of the other players right now. \n2.\tDepending on the model of car, there are limits to the min speed at which the accel / steering control kick in. My Civic has acceleration control all the way to 0 but steering goes inactive at 13mph. Can be annoying in stop and go traffic. \n3.\tDepending on the make and model of car, limitations in vehicle firmware may restrict the total degrees of steering the hijacked lane keep assist can apply to the steering wheel as well as the total amount of torque applied. \nIn my commute I have three spots where the limit will be reached and open pilot will ask me to take over.\n\n\nIf you're posting about it, then you probably already know, but I'm going to say this just to be clear. This isn't full self driving and you must continue to pay attention to the road. It does, however, make my drive one in which I sit back and drink my coffee instead of curse at other drivers."", 'I’ve been using this system for over a year in my Lexus RX 450h. I have only enabled it for lateral control of the vehicle, a.k.a. steering, because the system for stop and go in the Lexus by default is already pretty damn good.\n\nBefore I bought the Lexus, I owned a Tesla model S, so I have a great deal of experience in two different self driving systems at this point.\n\nMy model S was AP2, and there is no doubt that the Tesla is better at self driving at this point. However, there are no other vehicles in production right now that match the capabilities of my Lexus with the comma system other than Tesla. And certainly the Lexus with no self driving is inferior to the Lexus with self driving. \n\nBut I see it for what it is, and aftermarket assistant that makes my highway commuting time much more pleasant. I’m still paying attention, and my hands are near the steering wheel, but I have a great deal of faith that the system will keep the lane very accurately so I can relax a lot more than when I am having to pilot the car directly.\n\nI also recognize that machine learning will require people to participate in order to improve it to the point where it becomes mass market. We are all the early adopters on the curve, and I know that the system I bought isn’t perfect today, and it is unknown when it becomes better than my ability to drive.\n\nBut that’s OK. I am participating with a large group of people who are trying to advance scientific progress. And that alone is worth the investment for me.  Not everyone is going to buy a Tesla. But anyone who’s vehicle has the motors required for steering and acceleration and breaking, could potentially use this system to improve the capabilities of their vehicle. And if those people take advantage and purchase the system the roads will become just a little bit safer for everyone. And that’s absolutely worth the investment of time and money.', ""I would suggest that anyone with 2 hours to spare listen to the GeoHotz interview on the Lex Fridman podcast.

Our eyes and a very powerful neural net.\n\nAdding lidar, or radar for that matter, is making it unnecessarily complicated. The basic issue will be priority. Let's say you drive on the street at there's a vertical object on the side of the road. Camera thinks it's a person, lidar thinks it's might be a pole. Who is right?

With any disruptive technology that generally does not work.  The only past data that is relevant is the rate of computational/sensor/developmental improvement.  The very first self driving cars ever used for \'anything at a research level was all the way back in 2004 for the DARPA challenge.   That was truly ""Year 1"".   To give an analogy, commercial digital photography first came around in the 1980s, but it wasn\'t until the early 2000s that the technology became good enough, and cheap enough, to replace film.  Every year they were getting better, but were still so crappy that people didn\'t see the big picture.  I remember I was 15 years old in 1999 and my parents were photographers.  I was at one of their photo processing/camera stores and I remember asking about digital photography (mainly because I was using the internet and wanted a way to get pictures of my nerdy ass self to my internet friends).  The response I got was basically some smug operator telling me that digital cameras are stupid, are shit, maybe are ok for some niche application but will NEVER replace film and he doesn\'t deal with low end people and I was sort of a dumb kid for even asking about it.   By 2003 he was out of business.   That pessimism did him a whole lot of good.   His claim wasn\'t ""oh it may take another 5 or so years until digital is good"" but that digital photography will NEVER be taken seriously.  Never.    Not by 2005, not by 2010, 2015 or 2020. Film was a giant, Kodak was a giant, nothing is going to change that.   These were people who had more professional industry experience behind them than year I spent alive at the time.    \n\n\nThe big picture I am extremely optimistic about self driving cars.  As I mentioned up above, this isn\'t something that started in 2017, or 2009 (when Google started) but all the way back to 2004.  This is something that has been in the process for 15 years now and has seen progress, and major progress every single year.  Everything about them is getting better.  The processors, the sensors, the network connectivity, the machine learning, the artificial intelligence, ALL of it is getting better.   Eventually its going to hit a threshold where it works good enough to go live.    We had a Waymo rider post in this sub a while back and the question I had for them was ""Over the course of your Waymo ridership, have you noticed any increase in driving capability or reduction of driver takeovers"" and the person mentioned that they noticed a considerable improvement over the course of a year.   If Google decided to build a planned community in Silicon Valley and have all the private roads SDC the technology they have is now good enough.  Get rid of the human drivers and redesign a few of the roads and what they have now works.  Get rid of the human drivers and 2019 SDC tech works.  Because we have to mix the two its going to take a while longer.  Not several decades though.  Road improvements will come and make the technology work if need be.    \n\n\nMy prediction is that some commercial transportation as a service company will go live in some market in America in 2021 or 2022 (2024 or 2025 at the very latest).   This may likely be Waymo with their 80,000 pacificas and 20,000 Ipaces they plan on putting online over the next few years (which can effectively serve as many as 800k-1M people per day).   The fact they are talking to manufactures in Detroit seriously tells me this is something that they seriously intend to do.   The market that it will go live in will probably be Arizona, Nevada, and/or California.  Tesla may beat them to the punch with their Tesla network program.   It may be neither one and could be GM\'s Cruise, or Zoox, or MobileEye.   The dust is still up in the air for as to ""who""it is going to be but it is going to be someone.  There is a trillion dollar profit motive to get this going.   Someone is going to figure it out.   Very smart, motivated and \'greedy\' people don\'t leave a pile of a trillion dollars just sitting there.   Waymo is probably going to be the one who starts the race.  But someone is definitely going to start it.  When people who massively doubt this technology will \'ever\' and that its all a pipe dream, they remind me of the guy at the film processing place telling me that Digital Photography, will \'never\' take on.    A lot of people have mentality that progress in this area is literally impossible and improvements in the technology are impossible.   Despite the fact that dozens of companies are aggressively spending billions of dollars on this technology, its all just a big scam.   \n\n\nAnyways.  My prediction on the rollout.  My year is 2021.  If we all did a gambling pool that would be the year I would throw my bet in.  I could be wrong, it could be 2022, or 2023, or even 2020.  Its going to be isolated to a few places in the US at first.  But those places could be little backwater villages like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and a few other key places in the west.   Because of the multiplier effect (1 car serves 8-12x the people as an individually owned car) the adopters will be pretty quick.  Current Uber/Lyft users in these areas who do not own a car (which includes myself) will have the option of summoning a TAAS car to replace their Uber.  I predict that these TAAS cars will be priced to be dramatically cheaper than Uber on day 1.  Even if its only 30% cheaper.    In places like LA where driving is a pain in the ass, people are going to use the TAAS.  Hell, it may be cheaper to use TAAS than to park in LA (and definitely easier).   The TAAS adoption will happen very quickly with current Uber/Lyft users.  Whatever fleet company is running the cars will have no issue finding customers.    \n\n\nI have made the prediction before, but I think there will be use of SDC cars at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.  Japan is going to be the focus of the world for a few weeks and they are going to want to show off the absolute best of the best technology their country has to offer.  \n\nWithin a very short period of time there will be a massive user base.

It's great that people who don't have stakes in this matter either way, who can just hop in a car and go wherever they want whenever they want, can laugh at an industry running into some trouble - but for some of us that are disabled, and alternate between guilt over being a burden to their loved ones and terror at wondering how they'll get by if they ever find themselves in a position where nobody will help them... it doesn't feel good to have people gloat over the potential failure of something that is an important source of hope for us (and that's something which is beyond rampant here on this subreddit, where seemingly 90 percent of the posters here are either skeptical of the technology or against it outright). A robust public transport system would make this *much* less relevant of an issue, but America isn't known for its public transportation.

So, is there anyone out there (whether companies or random redditors) who think that self-driving cars actually have a bright future, and that said future will arrive at a reasonably decent speed? I hope this is just a hideously fucking horrible trough, and that we look back at 2018 and 2019 and think ""we really were excessively pessimistic"" like with all those people during the 1990s and very early 2000s who thought the internet was a failure because it took a few years to take off.",11,415,67,"[5, 3, 7, 2, 1, 1, 4, 16, 15, 8, 2, 4, 4, 2, 18, 10, 5, 1, 1, 4, 9, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3,

""Hey let\'s start a business based on thumbing or noses at taxi laws figuring that cities won\'t want to enforce their own Laws in the face of innovation"".', 'To be fair to Uber ATG they have done massive restructuring of their program to ensure safety is the first priority after that accident.', 'Also note that “Our self driving vehicles are acceptably safe to operate on public roads” is a mission statement or statement of intent. It’s the bar they are hoping to reach.\n\nIn the meantime Waymo and Tesla are testing their self driving vehicles in ways that don’t kill people (no, misuse of cruise control is not “testing a self driving vehicle”). Waymo has actual self driving vehicles driving on roads in relatively controlled environments with oversight negotiated with the state. Tesla is testing virtual self driving vehicles hidden inside the computers of customers’ cars.\n\nTo me, Tesla seems to be the company taking the most sensible approach by loading their existing human driven vehicles with SDC testing labs. If the SDC makes a mistake, that is reported back to the mothership with enough context to figure out what is going on. Tesla SDC do not engage in phantom braking which endangers others, and failure to stop for pedestrians will not actually kill anyone.\n\nWaymo is taking a cautious approach too by limiting top speeds, restricting operational area and carefully learning the traffic in that area before expanding the test further.\n\nHow does a self driving car fail safely? One option would be something like the Automated Flight Termination System attached to Falcon 9: an independent processor that monitors the car’s behaviour and severs the connection to the self driving computer when a failure is detected, bringing the car to a safe halt with hazard lights engaged? Should there be opportunity for a human to take control?\n\nWho would you trust with your life and the lives of your family and friends?

It’s wrong to make claims like this and sell a product (FSD).', ""Some points in defence of Elon Musk and his FSD/Summon predictions:\n\n1) Tesla severed its partnership with Mobileye in June 2016. Having to start from scratch surely added about 2 years onto the problem.\n\n2) Most people know FSD/Summon is a hard problem and predictions are just as hard to make. In the scheme of things it doesn't matter if predictions are off by a few years. Making predictions about new technology is always hard and to bash Elon for not knowing the future 100% seems misguided, in the context of him being the most visionary person alive.\n\n3) When he says 'feature complete' or solved problem, he is talking about taking their existing approach and scaling it up. Here is a good tech presentation on Tesla's FSD approach: https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness. There will be a period of 2-10 years of refinement, legalisation and roll-out. I'm sure California will see FSD long before the rest of the world.\n\n4) There are many incremental steps towards FSD and if you check the Tesla website you can see that selling FSD gives customers things like NOA which is something Tesla owners really value: https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/model3/design#autopilot\n\n5) There is no-one doing better. No-one can compete with the data advantage Tesla has, and they are doing a lot of work to leverage that advantage. I don't get why so many people bash Elon Musk and Tesla when he is doing better on FSD than anyone else. It's like the parents who's kid get 98% on a test and they say, why didn't you get 100%? Give the guy a break. If you think you can do better start your own car company from scratch.\n\n6) Kind of related to point 2 but more general to AI... There have been a lot of predictions by AI experts historically which were either hugely optimistic or pessimistic in retrospect. In the 70s many experts  thought AI would solve everything very soon, but there was a very long period of disappointment until neural networks and machine learning started taking off recently. Now some of the predictions are turning out to be too pessimistic like with Alpha Go. The point is that there are good technical reasons for having difficulty in making accurate predictions in AI.

(then add Security requirements and all of the testing)\nNot to mention no one has any idea how to validate a release of these cars. Government or industry. It's mostly, 'we did our best'.\n\nOr are you looking for the purely technical challenges?"", ""Verification.\n\nImagine that you've built a great self-driving system that turned out to be safer than a human.\n\nThen one day you have to make a change for some reason. Maybe the vehicle code  had changed, maybe you've fixed some minor problem, or maybe you've added some minor feature. \n\nHow do you verify your new system is safe?\n\nThe safety requirements are just crazy. Your car cannot be involved in a fatality more often than once in, say, 100 million miles. There are 100 lifetimes for an average driver. \n\nYou can test. Testing is great, but it is not sufficient. It can test only a tiny number of cases, and especially with machine learning based systems, there's no good way of ensuring correctness at all.\n\nI haven't even seen an outline of a solution to this problem."", 'Edge cases.\n\nAs with everything AI, the easy part is the 90% of driving situations.  The hard part is that 10%.\n\nIs there a stop sign?  Is the stoplight out? Is there sun glare making it hard to see the traffic light?  Is there a homeless guy trying to wash your windshield?\n\nBut it gets worse, Once you start accounting for the edge cases, you have to make sure your system isn\'t misclassifying things or situations.  Is that a construction worker coming to chat about the weather or is that a mugger trying to highjack your car?  Was that a plastic bag in the road or was that a kid that got away from their parent?\n\nThose sorts of unpredictable events are what makes SDC really hard.  You can try to do a ""always stop if things look bad"" but that might make the car overly paranoid (in which case nobody will use the system).  On the flip side, the last thing any company wants is ""foo company car plowed through a bunch of kids on a field trip"".\n\nThis, IMO, is what\'s taking SDC so long.  It is also a hard enough problem that the engineers doing SDC research underestimated how much of a problem it is.   It is why telsa has been saying ""We\'ll have fully autonomous vehicles next year!"" since 2012.  The problem is massive and there aren\'t really any breakthroughs that I\'m aware of.  It is just massive amounts of testing, collecting data, etc.\n\nMy prediction is that we are still at least 10 years away from a generally available consumer purchasable SDC solution.', 'So, I know you said non political, but I’ll add real quick that everything is political. And one big one is this...when can blind/non-driving people/ drive? And what can help them drive?\n\nI was able to drive before an illness caused me to lose vision enough to put away that steering wheel for good. My LHON began to affect me in 2012 and it took several months before I found that this was enough to take away driving from me. Not being able to drive was the most difficult thing in my life at that point. It never got easier. Having an appointment for my eye sight? Going to work? Going to just have any sort of thing I used to call fun? Nothing was allowed for me.\n\n I loved cars. I still do. Unfortunately having them as toys or helping people with their car problems was all I had. But technology progressed to have self driving be a possibility for someone like me, a legally blind individual to have hope. \n\nI believe in one: that people need to hear why people like me need self driving. For example, I am able to bike. I am able to walk to the store. To get what I need for myself. I have enough vision to get what I need to survive. But do you know what I can’t do? \n\nLift a ～30 pound bag of dog food and bring it all the way home. \n\nI can’t get to the airport to visit my elderly parents. \n\nI can’t get supplies to fix my yard and my garden. \n\nI can’t fix the outside of my house to please my neighbors because they don’t care whether my eyes are fine or not. \n\nWhat I can do, and what goes with the subject of this post, is to talk to my neighbors and my friends. To tell them that innovation isn’t regression and that politics shouldn’t discourage the advancement in technologies. People like me shouldn’t be confined to their neighborhoods because they don’t have the luck that other people have. \n\nPeople are people. Some are born ahead. Some have privilege and some don’t. \n\nPeople not realizing that this technology is important will be the hardest part to overcome. I have fought tooth and nail to get people to realize this without telling them my personal issues. When I tell them of my vision they agree with me. But when they don’t know an individual who suffers because of the lack of ability of self transportation they could care less. \n\nI try so hard, but man, people having their own fun and cool cars will always out weigh my small attempts of freedom. \n\nThe last time I drove was when I drove to the coast and prayed that it wouldn’t be the last time I could drive myself.', 'I am actually an engineering student who is looking into a Master thesis related to self driving cars. Software reliability is out of the scope of my particular discipline of engineering (automation engineer here). I was looking into something related to computer vision. So far I see lane detection, object detection and SLAM as particular self driving obstacles that fall in the computer vision domain. If there are any other self driving obstacles that fall in the computer vision domain then please let me know', 'If you haven\'t already, go watch Tesla\'s Autonomy Day presentation from last month. Lots of interesting details about challenges, and also highly technical.\n\nA big challenge right now is weirdo vision cases. They cited an example of a bike strapped to the back of a car, and how vision needs to interpret that as a single object and not a phantom bike.\n\nThere\'s also edge cases like what happens at a stoplight when the stoplight is fully out and humans are doing their best to sloppily navigate through the intersection.\n\nTesla also appears to be having trouble developing parking lot Summon (they\'ve promised and delayed it for a LONG time now).\n\nSo it seems to me that the ""single-direction on a highway with markers"" is mostly solved. The challenge now is figuring out scenarios where everyone has freedom to move/stop in their own way, e.g. parking lots and weird intersection scenarios.\n\nOne last area that I never see discussed is reading other drivers\' queues. The number of times I\'ve been saved (or helped) by watching where the other driver is looking (is their head turned away from me? are they texting?) or by accepting their ""wave through"" is countless. I wonder if FSD can/will have a mechanism for this.\n\nTo my last point, I\'m expecting that while overall casualties will be much lower with FSD, the incidents that do happen will be because the car didn\'t pick up on queues from the other driver.\n\nAnd what\'s interesting about THAT is that the FSD will probably be in the right, and there will be cameras that capture the video to prove it. Unfortunately someone will be hurt/dead because the car didn\'t avoid a situation that humans would have.', 'Lawyers']","What are some of the biggest challenges of self-driving technology?

This is how EVs will quickly become disruptive, when instead of 1 million cars serving 1 million customers, 1 million cars serving 8 million customers.    This is also how a fleet of 50m cars can provide transportation service for 90% of Americans and 50M cars can be manufactured within 3 years.  The convergence electric vehicles,  self driving technology, and fleet ownership will allow TAAS, especially TAAS pool to offer their service at a price point that is potentially 1/10th to the consumer of buying a brand new car.   This service won't get ALL consumers switched over to TAAS but enough of them to switch over that it would result in a cut in new car sales for that segment.    \n\n\nFor a fleet, especially a fleet doing local service within a city or within a metro area, Electric has some major advantages.  The cost per mile of electricity is drastically cheaper than gasoline or diesel.  Tesla advertises 4 miles per KWH, and right now a KWH costs about 12 cents, so 3 cents per mile.  If the fleet company uses solar to charge their cars they will get it down to 1 cent per mile energy cost.  In markets like California (which is the #1 car market in the country) Gasoline is $4 per gallon and rumored to go over $5 with the onset of new taxes.   Your car would have to get 400mpg to hit 1 cent per mile energy cost.  EVs also require far less maintenance than gas cars and are quieter and have a smoother ride.    For the Los Angeles market, A SDC fleet full of EVs competing against a SDC fleet full of gassers is going to have a huge competitive advantage and will be able to undercut on pricing.    \n\n\nFor the user there will likely be little or no commitment to signing up for a service.   Its not like the commitment required to buy a car.   You can sign up for Waymo and if GM Cruise offers a better price switch to them.

You would want to choose something that requires very little maintenance and can last for 500,000 miles or more.  You would want something that is easy to fuel with something that is not in shortage or needs to be imported and ideally you can generate on premises.     You are going to want something that can be very easily and cheaply cleaned daily and that is comfortable for your customers.  You aren't going to want to deal with fluctuating fuel prices or the infrastructure required to gas cars up.   You will want to make deals with local landowners to park and charge your fleet so your customers will have a Taxi that is very close to them should they need it (think churches who have parking lots that are empty 5-6 days a week)."", 'I would say that it is VERY likely that self driving taxis/shuttles will be electric. they\'re going to want to gradually displace taxis, buses and other transit. they\'re going to need the good PR of being ""green"". that, and lifecycle cost of electric cars are pretty competitive, even when up-front cost is higher. seems like a no-brainer to me.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to learn more about the forecasts for electric cars (bigger project on emissions/climate).  The numbers vary, but it seems like 20-30% of marketshare in the next 20 years \[[QZ](https://qz.com/1620614/electric-car-forecasts-are-all-over-the-map/)\]. 

&#x200B;

But there's also that interesting symbiosis of SDC's and EV's .. I've never quite heard it said directly, but I assume it's because the power demands of SDC's are more than you could get w a normal car battery (and then you'd need something else to turn gas to electricity, which would be efficiency losses .. so tl;dr not worth it w gas, right?) 

&#x200B;

So the question is really, can the momentum around SDC's work to increase the percentage of projected EV's on the road?

But if anything, I\'d expect it to accelerate in a hypothetical ""robotaxi"" era as manufacturer support will be required for all cars, and manufacturers will deliberately \'sunset\' models 5-10 years after they\'re released, rending the robotaxi essentially an expensive paper weight.', ""This is mostly true, but there is one counter force.   Old computers are obsolete even when they still work fully to spec.  As the car becomes more and more a computer, it faces that issue.   You don't want to get into a 10 year old taxi with 500,000 miles on it.  Or you will certainly not pay as much for that.\n\nSo you definitely won't pay double to double the life of a car.  Possibly not even 50% more."", ""My hope would be that, since they'll likely shift to being fleet-owned, they would be designed for recyclability and reuse instead of obsolescence. There will *absolutely* always be incentives to ride in the newest cars, meaning the cycle could actually get faster (in my opinion). Safety, comfort, etc., will make people want to ride in the newest possible models."", ""GM still has an incentive to obsolete vehicles sooner than Waymo. The problem is stranded assets. They now produce 10 million vehicles per year. But in an SDC world they don't need to build so many. In the short run making more cars might be cheaper than making them last longer. Eventually they'll have to close factories and this will change but in the short run there are too many car building factories, and too few car refurbishing factories. This won't be true in 15 years. \n\nThis also highlights how different a business SDCs are depending on how vertically integrated you are. Waymo doesn't care about how profitable their factories are, but GM/Cruise will need to for a long time."", 'Exactly.  With robot taxi everything changes with the development of a car.\n\nToday the company that sells the car loses money on every sale.\n\n“Yes, the typical new car sold loses a dealership about $200.”\n\nhttps://www.cargurus.com/Cars/articles/show_me_the_money_how_do_car_dealerships_make_their_profit\n\n\nThey make it through maintenance.   So car makers were never going to spend a lot of money improving maintenance.\n\nIt is the same with durability.\n\nThe look of cars change because that is marketing.   That does not help durability or maintenance.', ""They will definitely still be planned for obsolescence.\n\nThe difference will be When and How. With big differences in HW and SW.\n\nIt will be planned around minimizing maintenance costs while planning for the 'next generation'.\n\nHow long do you think a current SDC taxi EE Architecture, Compute unit, Sensor Set, SW, will still be a) relevant b) competitive. Upgrades will be required by competition and innovation. So maybe the chassis concept could be designed for longer use with the electronics designed to be replaced more often.\n\nWe haven't even touched on Security (and safety implications) of new exploits and trying to patch them. (especially if they are HW specific like Spectre/metldown, ZombieLoad)\n\nApple barely supports products older than 6 years old.  Who is going to patch and update SDCs longer than that?\n\nIf they are robotaxis chance are they will have paid for themselves in 3 years, operate another 3 at a profit and then sent back for retrofit/refurbishment or decommissioning.\n\nThe reality of maintaining the SW in an SDC older than 5 years becomes very expensive.\n\nThere will be very little incentive to make most of the vehicle last the current 15 year time frame.  Modularity will likely become popular. \n\nI think variations on the VW MEB concept will become much more popular. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group_MEB_platform"", 'Curse you, Alfred P. Sloane and your planned obsolescence!', ""Eventually planned obsolescence will become obsolete but not for a decades.  I have no data, but today I wouldn't be surprised to find out that a Waymo or Cruise car lasts 6 months without being completely upgraded with better sensors or compute stacks.  We haven't even begun to think about what a real SDC looks like once the steering wheel is gone.  To some degree the obsolescence is dictated by price points.  It costs a lot more money to build a car that runs longer.  If you are going to replace the car in 5 years because the physical shape of it will change there isn't much reason to build it to go 1m miles today.  \n\nI think 2030 is the earliest we will start seeing the designs settle out and we will see cars built to go 1m miles with basically no maintenance other than tire replacements."", ""I think the cars will be modular allowing pieces to quickly be replaced and serviced.  Parts of the cars will be very easy to replace with upgrades.  If there is some damage on a component the ideal with be to pop it off like a lego brick, pop on a new one, and reduce the amount of labor is spent keeping the car up and running.  I am really interested in seeing how they figure out how to automatically clean the cars to where they feel and smell new.    \n\n\nFigure these cars will drive 8x-10x as much as the regular car so they could do 500,000 miles in 3-5 years.   Because so much of the technology is constantly improving much of the car could go obsolete within 4 years so there will be a need to replace them.   But this short lifespan is why a SDC car is impractical for an individual to own.  After 4 years its obsolete and only drove you 40,000 miles.  Car companies will be competing against each other though and just because they have a fleet car that lasts 20 years doesn't mean people will want to pay to use it in 20 years.    \n\n\nLook at the other obsolesce.  Gasoline.  This is the big one that there is going to be a push to make obsolete.    \n\n\nThe government has put fuel economy regulations are car companies but if car companies are operating their own fleets they have a massive economic incentive to be as fuel efficient as possible.  Car companies, car dealerships currently do not pay for the fuel source for cars.  The owners do.  However fleet owners have a big incentive to save as much money possible for their fuel source fuel source.  That is why these cars are going to almost exclusively be EVs.  Likewise these fleet companies are going to want to get the absolute cheapest electricity they can get their hands on.  Which is going to be solar and wind (which are still dropping in price 7%-10% annually).  A fleet can have their own large solar arrays charge the cars to where their financed energy cost will be sub 1 cent per mile.  It will be impossible for gas cars to compete with this on any level.  This is a 50MPG car at 40 cents per gallon gasoline.  Not going to happen.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nThese large wind turbines you see around America,  they are 1.5-4 MW units.  A 1.5MW unit gives you 1200 KWH per hour of wind.  Round it to 5000 miles of driving per hour of wind.  They typically deploy them in places that get 8 hours of wind per day (or 3000 hours of wind annually) so a single turbine annually could supply 15 million miles of driving per year, at 10 cents per mile cost to the customer the turbine will pay for itself within 18 months.   And of the turbines that is a small one, the big ones are three times that size.    \n\n\n Likewise a four acre garage with a 176,000 square foot solar roof will generate 2600 KW of power when the sun is shining or 13,000 miles of driving per hour of sunshine.  In areas with lots of sunshine (where the majority of Americans live)  a garage can generate over 130,000 miles of driving per day at a price far cheaper than grid energy and an order of magnitude cheaper than a gas or diesel engine.  Even with efficiency losses bringing it down to 100,000 miles per day the alternative energies are going to have an enormous economic advantage.""]","Will planned obsolescence become obsolete in the era of robotaxis?

The NTSB recommends children under 12 not ride alone while Waymo doesn't allow anyone under 16.  12 makes a lot of sense today as this is when most start getting their own cell phones which would be essential when traveling alone.  I personally think 10 is the eventual correct age but I could be convinced of 8.  For everything below I'll assume a 10 year old child.\n\n>  Suppose the driverless car gets into a pickle of some kind, such as a human-driven car happens to rear-end the self-driving car.  You’ve now got your child mired into a mess, and you aren’t there to  help. Imagine the potentially traumatic impact on the child, having to  deal with the situation on their own. \n\nAssuming the child isn't hurt, what mess is there to deal with?  The kid just calls another car and leaves as soon as it arrives.\n\n> Another possibility is that the self-driving car encounters a situation that involves the AI deciding to bring the driverless car to a halt, parking at the side of the road, doing so because of some internal system fault or maybe as a result of the roadway conditions seeming to be outside the realm of what the autonomous car can handle. You’ve now stranded your child in a car, maybe in the middle of nowhere, or maybe in the middle of the worst part of town.\n\nHow are they stranded in the age of AVs?  Just call another car while hanging out in the air conditioned comfort of the stuck one.  These aren't gas cars and unless there is a batter problem they are more software stuck than hardware related.\n\n> Let’s also consider the aspect of whether a child inside a driverless car is going to be allowed to get out, on their own, if they wish to do so. Do you want your kindergartener child to be able to tell the autonomous car that it should come to a stop at the ice cream shop at the corner, and the child opens the car door and gets out, wanting to quickly get a fun snack? I doubt you’d want your child to be able to readily exit from the driverless car.\n\nYou would know if they did it.  I would assume you get notified of drop off and pickups for all the kids in your family.  If you need to physically restrain your kid from not doing something they aren't supposed to do you need to work on that with the kid.  You can't helicopter parent them forever.  Will it happen?  Sure, especially as they get older but you deal with it just like anything else.\n\n> You might say that the driverless car should keep the child locked inside the car, no matter what the child says or does.\n\nNo, huge saftey issues and the other is just snacking when they shouldn't.  There is no real danger in them making stops they shouldn't, only imagined danger.\n\n> Some autonomous cars might be outfitted with internal LED displays that indicate the status of the driverless car, being able to let a passenger know when the system or the car might be amiss and aiming to soon halt, but for children such displays or audio warnings could be confusing or scary, and of not much help.\n\nDoes the author have kids?  I spent years making up excuses why we couldn't go on the big top 10 scariest coaster in the world.  Finally I ran out of excuses around the time they were 10 and let them go on it without me.  No way I'm doing it.  Sure, some kids have special needs, but the vast majority don't have enough fear.\n\n> It is also likely that automakers will include an OnStar-like capability of being able to have a remote agent that can talk with the passengers of the driverless car, which might sooth the nerves of a child when a self-driving car is having difficulties, though the remote agent isn't actually there in the automobile with the child and unable to truly do much other than try to calm an otherwise possibly panic stricken youngster.\n\nThey can also call their parents.  Kids are pretty resourceful and more than capable of taking care of anything that can happen outside of a major crash.\n\n> I’ve predicted that there might be a new kind of role that emerges, a kind of autonomous car chaperone or nanny, a trusted adult that goes along for the ride to help support solo-riding children.\n\nThere is no purpose for this.

As a result, the driver often had to prevent the system from making poor decisions. \n\nI love navigate on autopilot but this is a mostly true statement, at least here in Atlanta.  I use it in the mode where I must confirm lane changes and I cancel 50% of them.  I wouldn't have worded it exactly like the article does.  I think it's very human like for Atlanta and will merge into tight spots just like anyone on the road would.  Where it fails is not seeing far enough behind the car and it will try to merge into an empty spot in such a way that it would cut someone off that is traveling 10mph faster than you.\n\n>  “It’s incredibly nearsighted. It doesn’t appear to react to brake lights  or turn signals, it can’t anticipate what other drivers will do \n\nThis is how I would describe it.  Very safe, just a bit rude because it doesn't see more than a few car lengths behind your car.  It basically assumes everyone is going close to your speed.  In a big 8 lane highway this isn't true at all.  Part of the problem I'm seeing could be cause by the lag of me needing to approve all the lane changes but I don't think that is it.\n\n> “The system has trouble responding to vehicles that approach quickly from behind,” Fisher says. “Because of this, the system will often cut off a vehicle that is going a much faster speed since it doesn’t seem to sense the oncoming car until it’s relatively close.”\n\nExactly my experience.\n\n> It is reluctant to merge in heavy traffic, but when it does, it often immediately applies the brakes to create space behind the follow car—this can be a rude surprise to the vehicle you cut off.”\n\nI've had the opposite experience.  I wonder if they have the follow distance high?  Mine is set to 1 which matches how everyone drives here.  If it was set to the default of 3, I could see this being an issue.

Nor does he believe padding time lines for unforeseen challenges. He recognizes progress is slowed by arbitrary schedule padding. I’ve been in plenty of complex project planning sessions and everyone likes to add padding. This greatly increases the timeline and cost of projects. All this padding gets pulled out with review and then gets added in as an additional cycle. If the additional cycle is not necessary, then the project completed sooner. Otherwise everyone on the project is executing slower and still in the end an additional cycle is necessary. \nConservatives are the most disturbed by such scheduling and there always needs to be assurance that everything will be fine.

This is a high bar to jump over.', ""To all those wondering why a tautology is relevant, I think the point is that the cars need to have a certain level of safety or (a different thing) **perceived** safety to even be allowed on the road. While the cars may be safer than humans, it will take a while to convince regulators to allow them. That seems to be where the question is coming from: how good do the cars have to be, to convince people? People being regulators and citizens who can influence regulators.\n\nI think that the self driving cars will need to be at least a couple orders of magnitude safer than humans to be allowed on the roads completely unsupervised. Here's why.\n\nUS auto accident fatalities are at around 37,000 per year.\n\nTesla market share is around 2%. Taking Tesla as an example here. Yes, there are other companies.\n\nIf Teslas were represented proportionally in the number of fatalities, there would have been 740 Tesla related fatalities in the last year. Instead, we've heard about what, maybe 3.\n\nIt's a truism that the media frantically reports on every fatal Tesla crash. So it's likely that the 3 crashes (if that; I can only think of two; I'm being generous) we've heard about are all that happened in roughly the last year. Sticking to the US for purposes of discussion.\n\nUnlike Tesla crashes, fatal non-Tesla crashes don't get wide media distribution. Sure, there may be a story in the local paper, but it's not syndicated and hyped up on major media networks.\n\nThis is the case today, without full self driving. It's safe to say that when we do have full self driving, the media coverage of any accident will be even more dramatized.\n\nGoing by the above numbers, currently the media dramatizes Tesla accidents approximately 200-fold. In other words, the same amount of ink is spilled for 1 Tesla accident as is spilled for around 200 non-Tesla accidents.\n\nSo, I would venture that to overcome this media effect around novel technologies, self-driving cars will need to be at least 200 times better than human drivers to even reach parity in public perception. To be *seen* as better (which is different from actually being better, a much lower bar), they will have to start with 200x better as a baseline, and improve on that.""]","Self-driving cars have to be safer than regular cars.

Hello

I have a background in remote sensing and I have been reading a lot about self driving vehicles. I understand on a high level as to how they function. I have read many articles and posts which go over the different sensor suite that these vehicles rely upon. However, what I am interested in now is to figure out what actual product (brands/model/version) options are popular in the industry for each sensor? Sensors namely being: 

* GPS/GNSS, 
* IMU/INS, 
* LiDAR, 
* Wheel Encoders,

The software is tightly coupled to the sensor and compute platform. Photoshop is simple: if you run it on a tiny laptop and it's too slow or runs out of memory, that's your fault. Driving is a hard-real-time problem. If your car runs out of memory or starts dropping frames, it'll probably kill you and others.\n1. Closely linked to this is validation. Although it's still not clear what regulations there will be to ensure SDCs are safe, it'll almost likely involve testing the whole system. The combination of software, compute platform, sensors, and vehicle need to be tested together, probably in an expensive process with lots of paperwork. Even if there ends up being completely inadequate safety regulation, no reputable software vendor would sell you safety-critical software that they haven't tested in the intended environment. It's just a recipe for lawsuits.\n1. The biggest players - the ones most able to support a retail business - don't want to sell their software at all. They're chasing after a huge market: personal mobility.

If you built a completely new town/city, you could regulate for just one system to be allowed (including banning human drivers) such that it could be the safest system around.\n\n\nSince that\'s not going to happen, any system will have to be able to work with humans and other systems on the road. Therefore, no-one will be able to ""shut-out"" any other system.\n\n\nThere might be consumer preferences if one system proves to be superior to the others but that will only go so far.\n\n\nIf an OEM has developed their own system that is the ""best"" then that is a source of competitive advantage that they won\'t want to share with others.

Sometimes it's more efficient to send a partially loaded truck by weight because it's full by volume, or by load bed area. (some loads can't be stacked)  \n\n\nSimilarly, most freight companies have dedicated routes for their heavy vehicles, and it's often unavoidable to send a heavy vehicle to a yard to pickup/setdown a load.  \n\n\nThe industry is already quite efficient in optimising loads and routes, that said, there will always be smaller players offering specialised services or competitive rates to breakup the larger giant freight companies.   \n\n\n  \nI'm sure there are good studies on this topic.

In the logging industry, it's very common to have a 3rd axle that supports the trailer when loaded.  It's unclear why they don't require more axles to reduce damage.\n\nAutonomous trucking will certainly remove a lot of potential reasons not to limit trucks to say 50k gross tons.  Very interesting point."", ""In general this is a great example of how there are so many side-effects (both positive and negative) of new technologies and how hard this makes it to predict what will happen in the future.  For example, if it was cost-effective to replace a large semi with several small self-driving containers, those smaller containers could be utilized for more purposes.  One night they could be used in tandem for hauling large shipments long distances, and another day one could be used by itself for a small local haul between residential neighborhoods.  Or maybe someone could even afford to rent one to sleep in while it drives them from one city to another overnight.  Maybe this specific example isn't possible, but there certainly will be many big hard-to-predict changes that indirectly relate to self-driving technology (just like there were so many hard-to-predict changes related to the invention of the automobile itself)."", 'Goods aren’t going to move themselves.

Soon everyone will be able to call a Waymo using the app, and a fully self-driving car will pull up with no one at the driver seat, to whisk them away to their destination.', ""The main difference won't be human transport. It's the ability to ship stuff without drivers, everything from pizza delivery to semi-trailers. And the ability to summon vehicles rather than find parking. The transport industry as we know it is heavily focused on reducing idle time, because people want to be paid by the hour. SDCs that aren't running don't cost very much, it just needs enough business to pay for when it's actively transporting things. That will totally change the capacity planning."", ""How unambitious.

We're currently in this weird limbo period while Waymo is perfecting the service, which causes people to pessimistically believe will go on for decades. It won't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are not privy to the progress being made so people think we're stuck, we're not."", ""I was born in 1984.  I turn 70 in 2054.  I figure with the rate technological change is happening the singularity will happen in my late 50s.  Whatever that entails there is a good chance the technology will exist to enable me to be 'alive' to see 2120.    I expect life to be completely unrecognizable and more technological progress will occur over the next 100 years than occurred over the last 10,000 years.    Neanderthals may have been closer to iPhones than we are to 2120 when it comes to technology.\n\nSo how about 2040.  I will give my predicted timeline for 20 years.  Figure everything can be fudged by 1-2 years.  Which in the greater scope of thing is not very much time.\n\n2020 -  The investment space and hype of SDC cars grows drastically.  Much like today there will be lots of of 'alllmost' moments.   There will be some display of SDC service at the Tokyo Games to showcase Japanese technology.   Waymo will clock 1B miles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2021 - Commercial SDC Taxi Service without a safety driver launches in some markets in America.   Publicly they will be fought by various people however their user base will be enthusiasts.   Groups that will openly be hostile to them will be labor unions representing drivers, car sales and support (mechanics),  political conservatives who typically hate anything new (I make this distinction because many conservatives will see this as a market triumph and a testament to American exceptionalism as this is predominately an American technology USA USA USA USA).  Me personally I anticipate the first time I will ever use a SDC without a safety driver will be 2021.   A SDC ride will cost 50-60% as much as an Uber ride does in 2019.\n\n2022-2023 - Regulatory approval will spread very rapidly in the US.  Some places will be political holdouts but major car markets like California will not.  All SDCs in this period of time will be electric as the battery prices will drop drastically.     During this time maybe 15% of drivers will give up driving.  Resulting in 40+ million used cars entering the market.  This will cause car prices to plummet.    Babies born in 2006 would be turning 16 in 2022 will find the SDC service very popular and will not value driving to the same degree that kids did in the past, for the most part their parents will want them using a SDC service vs driving if they have the service in their area.    Struggling Shopping malls will contract with fleets for free round trips to their mall as a means of getting customers in the door.   City governments will go lax on parking requirements and developers in many big cities will be building residential towers without parking but comprehensive loading/unloading zones.  Commercial trucks will allow 1 driver to work with a convoy to lead multiple SDC trucks.  This may be legislated as a means of protecting truck driver jobs.  However the truck driver shortage will be eliminated and driver wages will drastically decline as there will be a massive surplus of truck drivers.     Taxi Drivers and Uber drivers will be greatly disrupted.  A SDC ride will cost 30% of the cost of an Uber ride in 2019.\n\n2024-2026.  There will be massive investment of new companies in this space.    Catch up will happen very quickly.  Legacy car companies who are not becoming transportation companies will see a massive sales decline and may go out of business.   The sheer number of companies competing in this space will be comparable to the late 90s dot com bubble.   Because of all this competition the prices for service will plummet.  Some companies will give rides away in exchange for data.    The space will become over saturated and fiercely competitive.        Battery technology will be $50 per KWH so a battery good for 250 miles will cost under $4000.).   All of the lidar, cameras, sensors, and computational power that is required to do this will cost 1/10th as much as it does right now.   Fleet companies will be paying less than $20k for a car that does 1 million miles of service.  Cleaning it will be a major daily expense.   Solar will likely be 1/2th of 2019 prices so fleets will have their cars charged locally with on site solar.   Because of the low price of solar there will be much more of it in America.  California can expect to see 10x as much solar as currently exists today.   The oil industry will be greatly disrupted and the drop in demand will result in massive disruption in communities based around oil extraction.   Boom towns will become ghost towns.    Kids will see gas powered cars as old and impractical.  Especially kids who live in cities.  There will be cases where the user cost for rides will be zero.  Malls, Movie Theaters,  and Restaurants will offer free rides to get customers to come in.  Employers will start offering complimentary SDC service to their employees to get round trip commutes covered.    A SDC Ride will cost 20% the cost of an Uber ride does in 2019.\n\n2027.-2029  There will be a SDC bust.   .  The over saturated marketplace that has been a big dog pile of competition will contract.  The result will be that numerous SDC companies will go out of business and will get bought out by other companies.   This may happen a bit earlier but it will likely be affiliated with an economic recession.   Investors will lose money.  Companies will go out of business.  Some people, dumb people, will think this will be the end of the SDC and transportation as a service.  However comparable crashes will have been the Video Game Crash of 1983, where the video game companies went belly up, but by Christmas 1985 we had the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.   Also similar to the Dot-Com crash of 2000, which didn't end the internet, the big players came around after the fact.   After all the chaos is over there will be a few companies standing.   These will be the winners.    Cities around the world will be phasing out drivers because of the massive economic inefficiency that is traffic.   Buses and street cars will no longer exist as a viable form of mass transit.  Legacy subway systems will still exist though.   Pedestrian bridges will start to become more common so people may have a large area where they can safely walk or ride a bike without having to deal with the cars.  Think the High Line in NYC.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line)   Cities will become drastically more dense as parking requirements are eliminated.  Obtaining a driver's license in California will be very difficult and drivers will need to carry a $1M policy.  Gasoline will be severely taxed.   Gas stations will also be closed in mass.  Other than super rare museum worthy collector cars, gas cars will be worthless and most of the time you will have to pay someone to take if off your hands.   Even classic cars where tens of millions of them were produced most will not have anyone wanting to buy them.   A SDC ride will cost 1/10th the cost of an Uber ride in 2019.\n\n2030:  Its over. Outside of rural areas human driving will mostly not be allowed.    Much in the same way kids today can't believe how much long distance voice service was in the 90s, people will sort of jokingly think that it was crazy how driving was and how much people used to spend on it, especially parking!   Older generations will feel nostalgic.   Because of sophisticated fleet management systems traffic will be greatly mitigated.    Compared to today, it will be very cheap to get around.  No longer will lower income people have the financial worry of transportation.    New homes will not have garages and people will opt for more living space.  It will be very common for existing homes to turn their garage space into living space.  Especially in places where real estate is at a premium.   It will be common knowledge that AI is better at driving than humans in all conditions.\n\n2030s -  Everything keeps improving, and every trend gets stronger.  Cities prioritize fleet service as the way goods and people get around  Street crossing in some downtown areas will be prohibited (people will use the bridges) because it may negatively affect the flow of cars.  AI will compete against humans in various forms of racing and will eventually dominate.    Freeways will allow cars to travel drastically faster, 120mph average speed may be totally reasonable in a lot of places.  ICE cars will only exist as museum pieces.  If there are 10,000 ICE Car museums in the world and they each have 500 cars then there will only be museum demand for 500k ICE cars between the 1890s and 2020.  There are over 5 million collector cars in the US.   Far too many to really be scarce and historical artifacts of a time gone by.   The vast majority of them will be junked and only the best specimens with an interesting history will be kept in special museums.  The junking process however will detail every measurement and detail about them so they will be 100% authentically replicated in hyper realistic VR simulations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2040:  It will have been 15 years since the majority of Americans have driven a car for any reason.  People under the age of 30 will likely have NEVER driven a car.   Smog, traffic, accidents, and fatalities will be very rare."", 'This Medium article I wrote back in January 2017 only contemplates up to the end of 21st century, but it’s fairly on point:\n\n[This is the end game for autonomous cars](https://link.medium.com/Lr7iwLSOCW)', ""No streetlights?\n\nI'm sure by then vehicles will be able to sense one another from at least a mile away and adjust speed accordingly when they all reach an intersection."", 'Humans probably won’t be here', 'Probably, something like [this](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-new-shoreline-maps/).', ""That's a long time from now.  I anticipate a sub-human-level AGI (meaning it has capabilities like the type of adaptive/general agency that animals have but are missing from our narrow AI systems) before 2025 (possibly within just a couple of years) and a human-level AGI by 2028. Artificial super-intelligence by 2031.  \n\nI speculate further that artificial super-intelligence will propagate around the earth within a few years of appearing.  I also believe that it will not immediately become orders of magnitude smart than humans, because I think it will take some time to progress and also because I believe there are limits to intelligence.  However I do think that it could be several times smarter than any person.  That will be mitigated somewhat by AI augmentation of humans via brain computer interfaces.\n\nAIs may often have no real need for physical transport, since they can travel virtually instantly in two ways.  One, they may stream sensory input and motor output to and from remote bodies.  Or two, they can upload their current mental state to a remote body.  There may even be something like an rsync for artificial minds so that they only need to do an incremental update if they have visited that place before.\n\nIt's questionable how long unaugmented humans will stay relevant.  However, there will probably be a period where humans are relevant but they have a vastly decreased need for transport.  Virtual reality, robotic delivery, and other forms of telepresence will become much more common, as telerobotics advances to make this practical for more jobs, and as normal office work finally realizes what God awful waste of time commuting is for everyone and learns how to internet.\n\nModular smart city designs of the future also come into play over that time frame.  Imagine a modular multi-level city block design where all infrastructure is available for each section and level, including transport.  There could be very fast door-to-door automated transport between different parts of the city on different levels.  This might even operate like elevators that go horizontal in addition to vertical.  Many novel designs may be possible with modular smart cities.  That of course applies more to humans.\n\nArtificial super-intelligence may choose to spend most time in fully virtual simulated worlds which will allow them to teleport instantly.  There may also be some types of AIs that do not experience consciousness in terms of a single relevant place and time the way humans do."", 'Knowing how to drive a car will be as rare as knowing how to ride a horse and regularly riding one.', '>Teardrop-shaped streamlined design\n\nNothing to do with SDCs.

They look for other instances of irregular paint blotches in the database and feed it to a machine learning algorithm\n\nHumans flag the Autopilot failure by disengaging the system in the course of normal driving.', 'If you can determine what makes a driver good, you can exaggerate on that metric.', ""In the simplest terms, they're not train their networks to drive so much as training them to predict what happens next."", ""It doesn't, Tesla approach is inherently flawed.  Waymo has already came out and said this method isn't effective because the Neural Net learns bad human behavior, which effects how it will handle situations.  Instead, you need to let it learn on it's own so that it doesn't pick up bad behavior.  This means that Tesla offering will be inferior because it is always based merely on human habits, as opposed to developing better habits."", ""First of all, it just learns something wrong if every (or atleast most) human gets it wrong. (maybe cutting corners or sth)\nI think the real benefit is that it won't make mistakes like looking at a phone, being tired... and all those other human things.\n\nedit: also, not all things are learned from humans. When to slow down/accelerate is most likely not learned from humans atm."", 'I don\'t fully know the answer, they haven\'t said anything conclusive publicly. However, it is worth noting that an important part of driving safely is driving predictably, and so while it might be possible for an autonomous car to accelerate immediately after the car in front of you starts moving, but having a little bit of a human-like delay will probably make all of the other drivers on the road more comfortable, and so increase overall safety. I suspect that for most non-emergency situations, just because an autonomous car can in theory pull off inhuman feats of acrobatic driving doesn\'t mean it should. Hopefully in the decades to come, autonomous cars can gradually start getting ""better"" in a slow enough way that the expectations of human drivers and pedestrians can adapt.\n\nOne place that they mentioned in the presentation where direct machine learning from data is definitely worth it is in the problem of modelling other drivers. I wouldn\'t be surprised if their eventual system uses what a human would do as a starting point, then optimizes based on the expected behaviors of every other car it can see.']","If Tesla's self-driving is trained by current (human) customers, how does it avoid 'learning' the limitations and faults of human drivers? On 'autonomy day' they mentioned that they have ways to identify better and worse drivers, presumably statistically breaking down the data into some measure of, e.g., how jolty or smooth the driving is. But that as a basis can only train the network to be as good as a good human driver and there are plenty of limitations all humans are subject to. They stated an aim or expectation to better than any human driver.

For example, due to reaction times, the car will surely pick up on a pattern that all the human drivers training it always 'wait' some time longer than the car's own time needed to register the event and make a decision.

I think probably a lot of the disagreement on this sub might be due to one person arguing from a map light approach and the other person assuming their talking about a map heavy approach.', ""Typically something is considered scalable if you can increase the amount of work produced with a less than a linear amount of cost.  So if I can make a pie for $2 and I can make two pies for $3 then pie making is scalable.  Of course real world work has salability plateaus where each additional pie costs another $0.70 per pie until you can hit a threshold where you can buy bigger equipment or get better discounts.  You can actually hit points where making 10,000 pies cost more in total dollars than making 15,000 pies\n\nMapping has none of these qualities.  Parts of it have potential for improvement like better object recognition and automation but this applies across the board at whatever scale you are at and doesn't really make more mapping cheaper than less mapping.  The breakthroughs in the process are like buying better equipment to make pies but each additional map costs just as much as the last one.\n\nSo at any given point in time if you can do X of something for $y per item and it costs very close to $y*2 to do X\\*2 then your problem isn't scalable."", 'SDC enthusiasts pick and choose the problems they consider difficult, depending upon their preconceived narrative of which team they like best.

If you want to say this isn't scalability, then fine, but that is a nit-pick.\n2. **There is no possible process improvement or cost improvement from scaling mapping**: I think you can investing better software for changes and annotations, better and faster workflows, and better equipment from increased mapping volume. I'd guess collecting street view data is cheaper per-mile today than in 2008.\n3. **Won't know about construction until it's too late.** Construction projects take years of planning and approvals. Their start is published before hand, often in searchable database. \n4. **Anything that needs perfect maps is too fragile to work:** I think there are many situations in which maps help, but can't be relied upon. A tree falling in the road is a good example, traffic moving around an accident might be another, none of these are on the map, they must be understood and navigated around. These are what I call level 4+ events. The cars need to handle them. Understanding the old environment is still helpful in determining the correct action in this situation. Maps will need to be annotated simply, with lower precision and higher error tolerances. Think an incident on the road changes the scoring algorithm that makes decisions. Software can rely more on sensors than map. This mode might be much more error prone in the normal situation, but is used rarely and at low speeds the car is still safe enough."", ""A city has to be mapped once. Then every SDC using that map will update it in real time, i.e, construction zone, which will warn all other cars. My guess is human verification will rarely even be needed. The first car reports the anomaly and it's noted by the map. After the 20th car automatically reports the same anomaly the maps automatically makes the change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L95HhWk6OiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L95HhWk6OiA)""]","Mapping is scalable I constantly see people on this board who think HD mapping isn't scalable. I want this post to be the final word on why this is wrong.

1. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the US.  Not counting taxis, and other types of drivers, people who work in repair and maintenance and sales, and you driving yourselves. That's a great deal of labor to be saved. 
2. The SDC networks will employ hundreds of thousands of people and it will still be at least 2 orders of magnitude less labor. If I had to guess is driving related jobs go from about 30 million to 300k. 
3. SDCs will roll out market by market. Each market will have thousands of cars, they will need buildings for maintenance and repair, fleet operations personal, etc... So having some folks working on keeping the map up to date is a drop in the bucket. 
4. Also doing the HD mapping before launching in a market isn't harder than finding a space, allocating the vehicles, hiring maintenance and operations crews. Hiring and training will take months, HD map, much easier. 
5. There are 40k zip codes in the US. How many people per zip code does it take to maintain an HD map? 1, maybe less, maybe a 1/2 or a third. NYC has 145 zip codes. Do you think 145 people can't be hired to manage the NYC map? So I'd put the ceiling on map maintenance labor at 20k to 40k people. How is that not scalable? How is that less scalable than having a huge maintenance facility in every market?
6. Just to give you a comparison. Walmart has 4700 stores in the US. They manage inventory and stocking just fine. They manage a labor force of hundreds of thousands. So does amazon, home depot, Dominos pizza. Do you think SDC is a smaller opportunity than Walmart, 9% of us Retail sales? In the real world lots of business are operating at this scale. 
7. I have no answer to the question of is mapping necessary. But is it scalable? Yes, easily, laughably so. 
8. Eventually, lots of the mapping updates can be automated. That is a business optimization that won't be worth doing until you reach scale of deployment. This is the same issue with value engineering sensor suites (Lidar vs Cameras).  Lots to be done here in the 2030s.",42,473,10,"[9, 7, 5, 7, 2, 8, 1, 15, 21, 6]","[217, 209, 96, 70, 28, 99, 11, 265, 338, 92]",8.1,142.5,"{'post': [-0.4000000059604645, 1], 'people': [0.0, 6],

He is just intentionally letting LIDAR on the side, because he thinks there is no point in the long run.\n\nIf you look what he delivers, it is a mixed bag. The Tesla autopilot is the best driver-assist system available today, but it is not autonomous driving. He thinks he can deliver this within a year. Taking his track records in account, I doubt we will be there so rapidly.\n\nThe only company having something close to autonomous cars is Waymo in their Phoenix operation. But it is limited geographically and quite secretive. Difficult to say where the stand.\n\nIn the end what will count is who can deliver autonomous driving in most areas worldwide. Will the next iteration of the Tesla autopilot get there ? Will Waymo be able to expand to other geographies ? Is another competitor suddenly coming up ?\n\nOn another tack, I find it interesting that Mobileye has almost vanished since the divorce with Tesla. There are some interesting tech videos from them, but nothing available in a car. The Tesla autopilot, while slower than hoped, has come along quite nicely in the meantime.', ""IMO Musk's rational against lidar applies to radar too, after all, human drivers don't have the ability to detect microwaves or see through low density obstacles, but Tesla vehicles do have radar...and sonar. \n\nThe bottom line is, lidar was not mature when early models shipped and Tesla marketing is heavily invested in the car you bought being capable of level 4/5 autonomy so he has to take this position even though it's contrary to the design of his own product."", ""Gotta love Musk for the pure entertainment value of his position. He's adamant. He's unequivocal. And he knows a thing or two about LiDAR. And physics. And programming. And galvanising teams to take on the improbable.\n\nIf LiDAR was as cheap as cameras would he have built it into Tesla's hardware? Perhaps.\n\nWould you bet your house that Tesla won't be first to market with commercial FSD? I wouldn't."", 'Can someone well versed in self driving explain why lidar is not needed? It seems like a hybrid of vision and Lidar is absolutely needed.\n\nI am a computer engineer and from my understanding Lidar spatial analysis is actually significantly better from a security standpoint because it validates objects. Whereas camera’s dependency on visuals can be tricked. Take for example, someone erasing or drawing lines in the road. Or someone holding up a large picture of a car. \n\nI mean this would be serious fucking asshole move but assholes exists.', 'Could they both be right?\n\nI guess also both could be wrong.', 'Not sure anyone gets the big change that will happen with automated cars....you won’t own one, you will simply order them like a taxi.  If the price per mile comes down it will become cheaper to get a taxi everywhere than own a car. Why would you pay $xx,xxx for a very expensive price of metal to sit idle 95% of the time? \n\nInstead there will be different car variants for different modes of operation e.g. commuter car; family car; overnight car with beds etc. It won’t make sense to own them as they will be electric and therefore if you take a long trip you will just swap cars mid-journey.\n\nTherefore the cost of Lidar is incidental and tiny vs the business model of a car that will likely run for hundreds of thousands of miles with relatively cheap servicing - those electric motors run for a mighty long time with minimal servicing!', 'Agree with Musk on the remarkably expensive LIDAR devices which make the car price unaffordable ([Velodyne Lidar](https://velodynelidar.com/docs/news/This%20Palm-Sized%20Laser%20Could%20Make%20Self-Driving%20Cars%20Way%20Cheaper%20_%20WIRED.pdf)).  In recent talk at TechCrunch, Anthony Levandowski, a former engineer at Waymo also mentioned the unrealistic application of LIDAR on autonomous cars.\n\nOne more point is that Tesla is proving that their cars are operating well without LIDAR and if they continue to progress in this way,  the question is: Why do we need such an super expensive device like LIDAR on autonomous cars while we have better, cheaper alternative solutions?', 'The war is won by whomever completes the required minimum number of 9’s using the smallest wattage.\n\nThat is the deciding factor period end stop. The only factors are safety and power consumption. That’s why they have such a confident claim against the idea of using lidar.\n\nNow with that out of the way, in my personal I option I think it’s best to air on the side of “none” when comes to products emitting anything external to themselves.', 'There aren\'t many LIDAR that are ready for use on a car ( only one that I know of and it\'s pretty dated tech). This is probably the main reason you don\'t see them on Teslas. Also Elon is a know it all, so what ever he does is ""right"" and anyone using a different approach is wrong.   Here are the main benefits over a camera; LiDAR is immune to changes in ambient lighting conditions and it ""sees"" in the dark. LiDAR provides data in a very efficient way that greatly reduced the amount of compute needed to process said data ( when compared to a camera). It provides more accurate positioning data and can cover a huge FOV if mounted on the top of a car. Anyway, L5 will require a blend of tech ; IR camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS etc.', 'Lidar doesn\'t work well in certain conditions... rain, fog, snow...  so Waymo can operate somewhere like Phoenix where they rarely have those conditions. And they can halt their fleet under those conditions... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla is in a different position. Their fleet is already broadly distributed. For them... it is a ""fool\'s errand""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Waymo it might not be a fool\'s errand if they can get to market sooner in certain markets and certain conditions..', ""I mean, what if both are right? Why is one being wrong a forgone conclusion? \n\nTesla largely sells cars and the taxi fleet is an idea to the side of that, where others have it reversed. Maybe a few thousands of dollars makes the difference on individual transport, but doesn't make much difference when the taxi fleet is your primary goal, and adding another 9 or a few is worth it for a large fleet. \n\nMaybe they both get there in the end. Convergent evolution is rife with such examples."", ""War is quite an exaggeration, having said that I don't think there is a right or wrong perspective on sensors and design. It's simply a tradeoff. I read the article and this is an additional perspective. If your base function/product is a Computer Vision tool, obviously LIDAR is like having a jack hammer to drive a small nail. But there could be very well be a Level 5 prototype that has a sensor USP and is computationally not that intensive - a different solution to the same problem. Musk's hyperbole doesn't bother me as long as he drives competition to keep up the innovation gradient. \n\nP.S: Also, I wouldn't make the summary based on what Musk meant, it's not even remotely paraphrased."", '""War on LIDAR""?  Lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan I just assume that the article is shite?', ""Everyone knows Tesla's advantage is data, except this guy apparently.  It should have been stated LIDAR + Vision (Trained with limited data that is not statistically diverse) VS Vision (trained with 100,000 times the data that is statically diverse).\n\nNOW if Vision is required for FSD as all seem to agree and given that the accuracy of the Vision network will be directly proportional to the volume of diverse data and the sophistication of the trainer. You can see that Tesla clearly wins. They have soo much more Vision data that the problem is actually easier to solve than the others. Furthermore they spend most of their expertise on improving Vision where all others have to fuse Vision and LIDAR networks.\n\nIt is also not as easy as he says to catch up. It will take years and $10's of billions of dollars to install and begin to capture Vision data on Tesla scale. That whole time Tesla has massive first mover advantage and continues to collect data. It is likely no other company will ever catch them on Vision data, and if that happened, Tesla would at worse be number 2. Tesla will be able to tout the number of miles their AI is trained from as a correlation to safety for years."", 'Musk 2018 - Tesla absolutely doesn’t need capital raise.

Or, they can just provide a seat in a locked compartment for an additional fee or something.', ""First, this is a very good question.  Second, it has come up in the past and there is no good resolution.  A lot of people will say Taxi's won't be for families that need car seats.  Others will just say have cars with car seats in them.  Both responses sound like they come from people who have never actually dealt with car seats.  They are an absolute miserable pain in the neck.  I know families that have to buy very specific cars just because of their car seat situation.  This isn't a simple problem and anyone who thinks it is go find a family with three young kids and talk to them.\n\nA quick car seat primer, at least in the US.  [Each state has very specific laws](https://scdps.sc.gov/buckleupsc/safety_seat_law) about how and when you can use various child restrain devices.  There is huge variation from state to state and they change all the time because more is better, right?  Most states have children under 2 must ride in rear facing full seat.  Then from two to four they must ride in a front facing full child seat. From four to eight, sometimes as old as nine, must be in a booster seat.  After that they can be in a normal seat.  Again, some states have more complex laws and some are less complex, but this is the average requirement.\n\nSo while most people think about infants in rear facing car seats, they don't think about 4th graders still needing these seats.  Most families, unless they space the children very far apart, have the ENTIRE family in seats all at the same time.  So this means that most families need 2 to 3 seats to use a taxi.  This is just an unworkable situation.  To explain why you need to understand just how crazy these seats have become.\n\nA rear facing infant seat is an engineering feat.  Most come as two pieces plus a stroller.  The seat is detachable from a base that is permanently mounted in the car.  The same seat can latch into the car base or a stroller base.  From birth to one year of age, you never go anywhere without the seat part since it acts as a carrier, crib, etc.  Around one year of age, the child grows out of this seat and you have to buy another rear facing seat that is typically a single piece and stays in the car.  At this point you remove the child from the seat and the child walks on their own or are carried when not in the car. When they get around two, they have outgrown most rear facing seats on the market (back in 2014 anyway).  So you must buy them a front facing full harness seat.  Much like the 2nd rear facing seat, this is permanently mounted in the car and is not really detachable.\n\nSo these 3 seats from birth to 4 years of age are BIG and HEAVY and you do not want to carry them more than a dozen yards.  I helped my sister carry one two days ago and I about threw my back out as it's bulky and weighed 25lbs for my 2 year old nephew.  The other important thing to know is you really can't sit next to one.  If you have a car that will comfortably seat 3 adults on the bench, if you put one seat on the bench in the middle, you really can't get any adults to sit on that bench.  My brother-in-law died because of this fact as he tried to sit in the middle of a car seat and a booster but was unable to buckle his belt because it's physically impossible because of the size of the one car seat.  The booster isn't as bad.\n\nAbove 4 the news is a bit better.  These seats are very light, simple to use and not really a problem to stow 3-4 of them in a trunk.  They install quick and reliably and are only a pain because they are most likely useless at increasing saftey.  There are new studies that suggest a small increase in saftey but it's still very much an open question how effective they are for children above 4."", 'This topic has come up in the past.\n\nTo respond to your question in your post title, my initial thoughts were along the lines of, “They won’t, and that’s a big deal!”\n\nMy answer today is, “They won’t (at first), but it’s not a big deal.”\n\nThey will not be practical for parents with infants, because parents are not going to want to strap their infant into a shared infant car seat. There are other practical concerns as well.\n\nSo parents with infants will not use robotaxis at first. They can continue to use their private cars. And I don’t see manually driven cars getting banned anytime in the near future (if ever), so if and when that day comes, I’m sure there will be robotaxi companies that will specialize in serving parents with infants.\n\nPS Waymo Pacificas have convertible car seats installed in the third row today.', 'How do Human-Taxis do it now?  (Serious question)  I would assume that large metropolitan areas where a large percentage of travel is done with taxis and Uber/Lyft have come up with this issue, and hopefully found a solution.

They do have to test car seats before selling them so I assume they're safe (enough). Whether that's correct or not, I don't know. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/mifold-Grab-Booster-Seat-Slate/dp/B01H5VJJTE"", 'I’m just curious,  what do people do now when taking a taxi with a child?

Consumers wouldn’t pay $2,000 for a $500 car seat built into a normal seat, but SDC companies would.\n\nI’m certain that RECARO is already designing some options since they currently make both car seats and automotive seats.\n\nOut of all the problems, this one is fairly easy to solve.', 'There could also be an account option where you flag that you will need a vehicle equipped with car seat', 'Robo taxis will be built for being just that.

From time to time Autopilot reports its functionality is reduced due to obscured sensors.  The side and rear ones have no automatic cleaning.  If there is nobody in the vehicle, it has to hope it can travel to a place it can get cleaned.  If the blockage is serious, it may have to pull over.   If people are inside, they might have to have it pull over and then clean it.

It's like the responsibility of the person in the exit row on an airplane so far from prohibitive, but clearly a taxi service of any type wasn't in the minds of the engineers.\n\nPresumably, this operator would be responsible for cleaning the sensors.

Given Tesla's aspirations to achieve L4/L5 with the hardware currently installed in their cars, how will they achieve this without the ability to clean debris from their camera sensors?

Don't get me wrong, cheaper builds are important if you are building a physical good.  For the products we build, I have fought for and lost putting a $0.05 more expensive part on a ~$400 product because when you produce a lot of them, it adds up.  This is because that $0.05 part becomes $0.50 when you go to sell it and $0.50 * millions is money.  This isn't the case with something like an SDC.\n\nThe cost to build the eventual custom car isn't going to be so sensitive to the cost of materials, but the amount of income it can generate.  Look around at some of the small 2 seater cars that are produced today and compare them to the same quality car with 5 seats.  You will be surprised at how little money you end up saving.  That's because while making a 5 seat car is more expensive, at retail it's only a few thousand in savings.  As a taxi, those extra 3 seats can make you a lot more money.\n\n> ..weigh less, be more energy efficient..\n\nThere isn't that much difference in the energy efficiency between a car that is even 2x heavier.  This is because weight isn't that big of a factor with rolling resistance.  Sure it uses more electricity, but not that much more and BTW, electricity is your smallest cost so it doesn't even matter.  What costs a lot of money is having excess cars doing nothing because they are a bad fit for the current demand.  I can service almost any ride with a 5 seat car, but only some rides with a 2 seat vehicle.  To deliver an average 2 minute wait for a given market I'll need a lot more cars if they are a mix of 2 and 5 seats.  They would have to be MUCH cheaper to run to justify.

Tesla obviously is designing their own cars already.\n\nBTW, this should also enable cars to be far cheaper to build and the with electric powering the cars and a computer driving we should get the cost per mile cheaper than today while also offering a better user experience.\n\nImproving both is how you get rapid uptake of a new technology.']","Why not make self-driving cars smaller? Just a shower-thought but if 80% (wild guess) of all the cars in traffic is only transporting one person, shouldn't 80% of the self-driving cars be designed for that purpose? I.e. the biggest market will be for these smaller cars.

So if a car is made to transport one person, we can reduce its size, which makes it cheaper to produce with less material, weigh less, be more energy efficient, and you can fit more of them side by side on the roads helping even more with traffic congestion.

Why not include both on the cars until we know for sure?\n\nUpon seeing Tesla’s Autonomy Day presentation, I’m starting to think Computer Vision might pan out after all. \n\nAs someone posted earlier, the idea of being driven around freeform is a lot more appealing than driving off a database. \n\nMy other concern is that I don’t trust legacy carmakers to keep maps up to date. Look at what a great job they do of updating maps today.', 'You will get a pretty strong disagreement on this sub on who has the better approach.\n\nI really hate looking at it purely using LiDAR versus using cameras.\n\nTo me it is more about driving off a database versus free form driving.  Well a name I made up but really needs a name.\n\nIMO, this is a super hard problem and the better approach is to drive off a database to get to a point it works.\n\nOnce you have working it is a lot easier to move more and more to using the approach Tesla is taking.   So do parking lots maybe free form for example.', 'Some thoughts:\n\nI hate how Musk makes this an ""us vs them"" issue which radicalizes his fanbase. For example, I recently watched a Waymo presentation on YouTube, looked in the comments and there\'s ""Lidar is a crutch"" comment. He\'s basically calling everyone else in the industry stupid without any tangible evidence... this man has an enormous ego. It\'s impossible for me to root for someone that disrespectful.\n\nTesla had two options, bet on a camera-only system or give up on FSD. They can\'t use Lidar because of cost and aesthetics.\n\n7 years ago, Waymo was better at self-driving than Tesla is today. They reached the milestone of handling 10 100-mile routes that were carefully selected to capture the full complexity of driving without human intervention. Tesla isn\'t in Musk\'s words ""feature-complete"" and had interventions in their short, fixed and easy route in the recent autonomy event. So their system is probably on par with Waymo\'s as of ~8 years ago.\n\nPeople are making all kinds of overconfident assumptions but the fact is, we don\'t really know how these systems work. One example: we just need to throw lots of data into the neural network and that basically solves self-driving, easy! Because a self-driving system is basically a neural net, right? This is just... stupid on so many levels.\n\nTesla is trying to oversell the fleet-learning argument because that\'s the only advantage they have and the purpose of the Autonomy *Investor* Day was to convince investors and customers to give them money. But the actual usefulness of this data is simply unknown.\n\nAlso, what\'s the evidence that camera-only perception will have a sufficient accuracy for FSD in the near future, especially at night?', '""LiDAR adds about $10,000 to the cost of the car"" is such a bad point of argument.\n\nNo shit, a sensor that requires the precise alignment of 128 lasers and 128 sensors and doesn\'t sell a lot of units is expensive. If/when these things are truly mass-produced by OEMs or [companies who already know how to mass-produce optical sensors](https://www.therobotreport.com/velodyne-lidar-partners-with-nikon-to-mass-produce-cheaper-lidar-sensors/), the price per unit is going to get a lot lower.\n\nSee also: basically every consumer technology.', ""This video asserts that companies build their planning features using just machine learning, I think Tesla is the only company on record saying that's their approach. \n\nHe then goes on to say that Tesla has the advantage because of their larger fleet, but again this assumes that everyone is using their approach which Waymo is on record saying it's not.\n\nLidar vs camera isn't the debate since most the big companies using lidar also use cameras."", ""Tesla can't use lidar because it's too expensive, that is why Elon is saying it's silly now, but lidar and cameras will always be better than cameras alone.\n\nElon basically admitted that vision isn't solved, and that you need lidar until then. Nothing is preventing Waymo and others from dropping the lidar if vision ever gets good enough.\n\nTesla has already killed three people with their machine learning experiment, Waymo has caused no fatalities. Clearly Waymo's approach is the safest and the only ethically defensible one.\n\nBut you have to give it to Tesla, they have convinced their customers to not only be their safety drivers for free, they even pay a premium for it."", 'I think showing what Tesla was able to create with the city rendering in the demo and its points about lidar being a crutch really sets the correct tone.   You can use lidar but why?', 'Cheap solid state  LiDAR sensors will become available around 2021. Bosch is building the fab right now: [https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/bosch-invests-11-billion-double-chip-production](https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/bosch-invests-11-billion-double-chip-production)', 'Both Tesla and Waymo have great strategies.\n\nIt’s almost certain that cameras alone will eventually be enough (that’s what humans use). So, long term, Tesla will have self driving vehicles.\n\nBut state of the art camera-based computer vision right now is not good enough. So maybd Waymo can get robotaxis onto the road sooner. They’ll be able to make money (the income Tesla claims a robotaxi generates probably covers Waymo’s sensor suite). And Waymo has cameras too! While they’re making money they can keep working on their camera based vision until they can remove LIDAR also.', ""The problem is data gathering. Tesla's approach generates more data due to the fact that they have more cars on the road. LIDAR vs vision is not the real problem, the problem is which approach will gather the data required to train their NN fastest. Tesla appears to be more advanced in this aspect."", 'No one has brought this up, so I will. He is incorrect about Waymo One being an automated tax service. \n\nYes it uses those Chrysler Pacifica‘s, but there is a safety driver. Also, it is not open to the public, it is a closed and limited membership. Actually, as far as I can tell waymo one was simply a PR stunt, they already had a limited self driving tax service with safety drivers.\n\nEdit: grammar', 'I feel like this subreddit should be renamed from SelfDrivingCars to WaymoFanbase', 'They are the only cars on the road in real world unlocked environments and safer than normal\ndrivers.', 'Have you ever heard about a thing called radar?\nHaving one in your car effectively provides you with a relatively long-range (~150m), reliable distance measurement sensor, that works in fog/rain/snow. Newer models can even provide you with several dozen locations measured (think of it as a point cloud).\nWorks like a charm, relatively cheap (already less than $100 per unit), proven, reliable.\nLiDAR is not.\nThe only purpose LiDAR has currently is near-range sensing, more specifically to have some sort of ground truth.', ""I'm surprised no one has tried to hybridize them to get

This is once you have the car and are driving it.  Their marketing would have us believe differently however', ""I, someone currently with a learner's permit, am beta testing my human driving software on live drivers."", 'The interesting thing is that this is not a secret nor is it illegal. In fact, to activate the settings for the autosteer or navigate on autopilot or summon mode, you need to agree to an open beta agreement and you are told by everyone from staff to other owners/drivers to the car itself to keep your hands on the wheel. It\'s no different as an agreement to an online game that is in open beta that you pay for. You should be aware there are issues that in fact you are likely to find that will be fixed as they are found. Those issues shouldn\'t *kill* you if you are using the system properly. In autopilots case, you already have control of the wheel, you tap the brake which is a direct physical circuit cut to the motors\' power, and you slowdown and regain control. It does not matter what the computer of the autonomous software is communicating to the motors, power cannot be put through to the motors *physically* if you have your foot on the brake. This is FUD directed at Tesla, but it will impact all of the autonomous driving industries\' customers if media outlets keep up this low-hanging fruit nonsense. Every grieving family is going to want to find someone to blame. That\'s absolutely understandable. I think blowing your money on legal fees is a bad way to cope but how can I judge? I\'m more disgusted with the lawyers that convinced them to go through with this because if they even got moderate traction it would benefit their careers. Articles like this can set back a future that is infinitely safer because people wouldn\'t make predictable irrational mistakes on the road. In this man\'s case, his error coupled with lack of a crash attenuator on that highway (damaged from a previous crash and not dealt with by the authorities in time) caused his death and that is tragic. It\'s hard to swallow but this is true. Creating ""a false sense of security"" is not a crime. My chocolate lab gives me a false sense of security. I\'m not going to sue a breeder if someone robs my house.', ""Not that I think tesla is at fault, but I am interested to see what information we can learn from this. I had to go into my settings and turn on Autopilot. It's not like the car just starts driving itself with no warnings. \n\nOverall I think the law suit is partially justified. More so the state part. They didn't repair that barrier. Had they done that, he'd be alive"", ""My big issue with the Tesla model for development is that their beta testers (customers) aren't trained or prepared for when the car makes a mistake. A paid safety driver is trained specifically for these events, to ensure the safety of those inside and outside the car. I'd at least call it irresponsible to just let people figure it out on the fly, when it comes to re-gaining control of a vehicle at speed.\n\nPersonally, I don't love the idea of my life potentially being in the hands of someone else, when it's their first time performing a high-speed takeover in a car driving itself."", ""I'm going to be the devil's advocate.\n\nYes people are agreeing to use the beta software, but they know damn well people are at risk by even offering it.\n\nIf you think Tesla is not at all at fault, you must think cigarette companies don't carry any fault either."", 'Really would think a ""techie"" would know better.', '>**Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers**\n\nIs this supposed to be some revelation?

While traditional OEMs are taking safety-first approaches - ASIL, redundant safety concepts, etc., Tesla prioritizes functionality first. While this lets them be first to market with self-driving tech, it is a risky game, as accidents like this are much more likely to happen. And to make it worse, while they communicate the limitations of the self-driving tech clearly to individual drivers, their marketing department frequently exaggerates the capabilities of the auto-pilot.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to see the legislation catch up with self-driving tech, making the Tesla approach illegal for cars sold in NA/Europe."", 'Time to go drive into a lake and blame my gps.  Anyone who expects their car to be a perfect driver in the beta phase (even though they are an imperfect human driver too) is just not being logical. Traffic deaths like these are tragic, but far less tragic than normal ones, because these people aren’t dying completely in vain, their deaths are bringing about more progress towards safer roads.', 'What seems to be missed in the discussion is that every driver assist system today will do the same thing and most likely worse.', 'I’m no lawyer, but I imagine it will be easy to prove that this man was explicitly made aware he is responsible for the vehicle. I also believe it will be difficult to prove he was explicitly made aware he is NOT responsible for the vehicle. If I was him I would have kept my eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. \n\nHowever, I root for Tesla, so I’m probably biased. I do wish they had driver monitoring software and forced you to keep hands on the wheel longer than 34/60 seconds. The people who have died might not have, and there might be less skepticism of SDC’s in general. They could continue refining their software while also preventing deaths, until their FSD was (if ever) ready. I believe the 3’s have driver facing cameras for future SDC fleet management, disappointing they couldn’t be used to force dangerous drivers into being more attentive.\n\nHopefully Tesla either makes it harder to not pay attention like this guy, or they quickly develop a FSD stack that is extremely safe.  I’m excited by Elon’s timelines, but I’m worried not meeting them will result in more ignorant, over-confidence like this case.', '“Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers”\n\nThis is just not true.

And they occupy a space of 210 football fields for parking. Singapore, with a very different policy, would need 1 out of 3 cars, if they were robotaxis. Anne Arbor would need 18,000 instead of 120,000 cars. NYC would need (for a coverage of 98%) only 3,000 robotaxis instead of 13,000 cabs today. Munich would reduce their fleet by over 92% from 200,000 private cars to 18,000 robotaxis.\n\nAlso consider that not more than 10% of people are actually moving during rush hour. And given that a) you can empty all those parking spaces, and have way more space - the city would feel less congested, and b) with eelectric robotaxis you can imagine new forms of vehicle sizes, such as monopods for one person only etc.', '[deleted]', 'It wouldn’t, if the robotaxis don’t require carpooling. Traffic will actually get a lot worse because children will be able to order taxis to get to practice, rehearsal, school, etc. \n\nEveryone will still need to go places even when we don’t own cars anymore. We’ll do it then as we do it now, except with an AI driving instead of us. And with increased access to rides via smartphone, there will be many more riders on the road than currently.', 'Depends on peak traffic and that is different in each city. Generally you would need 1/5 to 1/4 of current cars.', ""This is a good question.  I don't have the numbers, but here's the assumptions and what I think you'd need to plug in.\n\nYou'd need enough cars to manage rush hour load.  So lets say that at 8:30 the maximum number of cars are on the road driving into the city, and at 5:30 the maximum number of cars are on the road driving out of the city.  Assuming no carpooling, that number stays the same.\n\nHowever, anyone going substantially earlier, and everyone going substantially later, can reuse the same cars as before.  So if 30% of your population doesn't need to be in the office at 9am and doesn't leave at 5pm or whatever, they can use the peak commuting cars when they aren't being used.\n\nDaytime usage for runs to the grocery store, etc, can be done with the peak cars.\n\nCompany vehicles (like what your cable guy drives) won't go away, too much equipment.\n\nBut without knowing what number of people have cars for non-peak-time commuting vs have cars for only peak-time commuting, it's hard to tell what real number the reduction will be.\n\nAnother assumption -- it will be much easier to take heavy rail if a robo taxi is cheap, because you don't have to park at the station, and taxis can be synced up to pick you up as the train arrives.  So we might see robo taxis actually cause more use of public transit."", 'Many researchers have attempted to come up with answers.   My best guess is that at most 25% of the fleet is at use at any one time, excluding radical events like a hurricane evacuation where people would need to carpool, or cars return to pick up more people if the fleet were that small.\n\nOf course, the cars are engineered for a number of miles, not years, so just as many cars are made.  In fact, more are made because people travel more with more convenient transportation.    Unless they carpool or you engineer them for more miles, as Tesla claims to have done.', '90% of passenger miles in America will be driven by 50M SDC cars.', ""The actual question has been addressed fairly well, but more interesting to me is a question that emerges from it...\n\nSelf driving taxis don't feel like a natural monopoly to me, or at least a market where monopolistic pressures will actually result in one...  How many major service providers are likely to exist? Obvious the more providers with small client pools the more inefficiency, but is the typical city likely to end up with 2, 3 or 10 competing service?
