The GTX 1650 beats the Vega 11. Thus we can conclude that the 5300M beats the Vega 11 since it also beats the GTX 1650 tested here with a [gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogd5p8UZdR8) comparison (5300M vs GTX 1650).\n\nTo conclude, I was very surprised by how underwhelming the performance was from the SL3----from the CPU to the GPU and to even the SSD speed. At the same price, the difference in performance shouldn't be this substantial, not mentioning the SL3 also has worse thermal cooling (reached 105 degrees!!!)--but you do get double the RAM I guess?\n\n***DISPLAY:***\n\nThe highest I hit on the SL3 15's 2K display is 367 nits, which is about average, and 466 nits on my 16\" MBP, which is great. The display quality between the 16\" MBP and the SL3 is also huge. With only a 93% sRGB color range, **you will not be able to do any professional work relying on color--this laptop is a no go for artists, designers, content creators, video/film, anyone that focuses on color.** The SL3's display is not professional grade. It's fine for media consumption, but if you mainly want to use it for browsing/media, there are other laptops with better/similar displays and performance for almost half the price--or even the intel i5 version of the SL3.\n\nThe 3K display on the MBP on the other hand is rated as [one of the best](https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Best-Notebook-Displays-As-Reviewed-By-Notebookcheck.120541.0.html) laptop displays. It has 100% DCI-P3 and 93% AdobeRGB--the display quality alone is worth 200-$300 compared to the SL3. Another advantage Macs have is their image/text scaling. TLDR, MacOS does a better job of scaling various image/text sizes. The reason why many professionals use Macs is because of the better scaling and color consistency/calibration, especially since you\u2019re working with higher resolution workflows and need to frequently rescale. It\u2019ll be a lot wiser to have the better scaling from MacOS in this case. True Tone is also useful when the ambient lighting changes in your surroundings, but for maximum color accuracy/consistency, I would recommend you to turn it off. The 16-inch MBP display also has a better reflective coating and better viewing angles than the SL3.\n\nTouchscreen/touchbar wise both aren\u2019t too useful in my opinion. With the touchscreen you can scroll/touch links I guess? But most of the time it\u2018s really awkward/annoying because I have to reach further from my keyboard when I\u2019m working\u2014which slows down my workflow\u2014when I can just use the trackpad which is not only closer, but also more accurate/easier to use than touch. I also find that besides the scrolling here and there, I barely use it. Also, it\u2019s a huge fingerprint magnet and messes up your screen. The touchbar is slightly better because you can customize your keys and it\u2019s actually useful for some workflows, but the problem is that it lacks app support and it sometimes freezes/is more convenient to have physical keys most of the times.\n\n***BUILD/OTHERS***\n\nThickness and weight wise, both are about the same (0.57 inch 3.9 pounds SL3/0.64 inch 4.3 pounds MBP). Both are very well-built machines made out of aluminum. But the difference in battery life is significant--up to 4 hours more on the MBP. With normal web browsing at 300 nits, the SL3 lasted 6 hours while the MBP lasted 8 hours and 24 minutes. At 300 nits while working on video/photo editing and some light gaming, the SL3 lasted only 4 hours and 17 minutes. In comparison, my MBP at the same brightness and workflow lasted close to 7 hours. Performance on the SL3 also drops dramatically when it's not plugged in--around 40-65% depending. The MBP on the other hand stays roughly the same (less than 15% drop) without being plugged in. As a result of constant charging for performance, the SL3\u2019s battery will deteriorate faster in the long run. This also happened with many of my windows laptops. My 2017 Dell XPS has already dropped by roughly 50%, whereas my 2016 MBP lasts me 3 hours more.\n\nThe keyboard and track-pad on the SL3 however, was a pleasant surprise. Although it\u2019s still clear that the MBP's track-pad is still a tier above every other laptop, what the SL3 has to offer is very good--one of the best from the windows side of things. The keyboard on the SL3 is also great, although still not quite in the same tier as ThinkPads and the new magic keyboard on the 16\"--but Microsoft is getting very close. Audio wise (speakers/mic), the 16\" wins hands down in this area as well. MBPs has always had the best audio, but the 16\" takes that a step further and makes the older gen MBPs sound outdated, even though they had the best speakers already. The SL3 however, has a better port selection and doubles the RAM. But weirdly it doesn't have any thunderbolt 3 ports, whereas the 16\" MBP has 4. In order to get the same ports, you'd need to spend $50 more for a port hub on the MBP--then again, the extra thunderbolts are very useful for professional workflows. And although Microsoft claims their SSDs are \"removable\", they make the process [a pain in the ass](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-ssd-repair-upgrade) to do so. But nevertheless, it's still a step forward from Apple's soldered on SSDs.\n\nTo conclude, the Surface Laptop 3 does a great job in terms of feel and design----but the performance (CPU/GPU/SSD speed), display quality, and battery life you get when compared to the 16\" MBP at the same price is almost laughable. At the same price, the 16\" MBP beats the SL3 in literally every category besides storage/ram amount. I understand that you don't have the same ports, but you can spend $50 more to get a port hub and get MORE ports than what the SL3 offers--aka 4 extra thunderbolt 3s while getting way better performance/display/battery/etc.\n\nIn terms of professional usage/workflow, it's a no-brainer to get the 16\" MBP. You're essentially scamming and handicapping your own productivity if you buy the SL3. However, if you want a device for average/light use, then I would actually recommend you to get the **13.5-inch/i5 version** of the SL3, or the Dell XPS 13, or a ThinkPad. If you're a designer/artist/in fine arts, then you should definitely get the 13-inch MBP for its top-of-the-line color accuracy/consistency/calibration. Here is more information regarding 4K OLEDs in the **display section** of my [XPS 15 comparison.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dz7ewx/macbook_pro_16_vs_dell_xps_15_7950an_indepth/)\n\nAlso, **DO NOT** buy the 13.5\" i7 version of the SL3 even though it has a 10th Gen i7. It might seem inciting, but the thermals/performance is lacking (mainly because of the lower end GPU which also forces more work onto the CPU while in a smaller body).

The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.\n\nBefore throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.  \n\nThis combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!\n\nedit - the AirPods are also draining \"evenly\" now!  Before, one AirPod would drain faster than the other.", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dz9hb9", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dz9hb9/psa_tip_for_those_experiencing_diminished_airpods/",

Oh, and SFSymbols are in use everywhere for a more native Apple feel compared to previous versions\n* v5 also brings a new way to save and organize your content: Save Collections! Long press on the post save icon and store posts in an unlimited number of custom folders, which sync automatically between all of your devices\n* v4 brought fully customized themes! Express your creativity, create new themes, and share them with other Slide users\n* v4 overhauled menus throughout Slide to [match iOS 13's new standard menu design](https://i.imgur.com/6HBODwy.png), complete with link previews\n* If you are interested in a full changelog for these last two updates, you can find them on our community subreddit, r/slide_ios! Both updates boast over thirty new features and many other improvements and bug fixes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other features that make Slide unique include\n\n* Beautiful **iPad display options**, including [Multi-Column](https://i.imgur.com/WisO9uX.jpg) mode and [Split Content](https://i.imgur.com/tW9cFtb.png) mode\n* Comes with a companion Apple Watch app\n* Thousands of theme options and hundreds of other settings allow you to **make Slide truly yours**\n* Full support for native rendering of Reddit Markdown, [including scrollable inline tables](https://i.imgur.com/4hwJ1B4.png), quote boxes, and code blocks\n* **Full moderation suite** with a separate Moderation dashboard makes moderation a breeze\n* Slide is **fully offline capable**, with configurable sync settings that let you bring your content anywhere, internet or not\n* Read Later allows you to save posts to a separate pane of the app so you can re-visit posts for reading later\n* Subreddit content filters let you hide content types you don't want to see from individual subreddits, and a full filtering suite lets you hide posts matching flair, titles, self-text, and more!\n* Much more for you to discover and enjoy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlide is fully open-source, [which means its entire codebase, including all Pro features, is available for free online](https://github.com/ccrama/Slide-ios), and developers can create Pull Requests for additions to Slide! It also allows privacy-conscious users to see exactly what code is running on their devices. Hint: there is no tracking, no ads, no analytics, and all Reddit features are available for free to everyone :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and I hope you give Slide a try! Want to connect with me? Feel free to send me a PM or email, and [join us on Slide's Discord server](https://discord.gg/kQNRH2S) where we discuss features and development.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor y'all who like screenshots, [here's a few more](https://imgur.com/a/NZrmiOi) showing off how customizable Slide is!\n\n# [Slide on the App Store!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slide-for-reddit/id1260626828?ls=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nCarlos", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dwbd1g", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dwbd1g/dev_slide_for_reddit_v5_is_available_now_fast/", "author": "ccrama", "children_name": ["netflixo", "JoyRoadExitNine", "SiakamIsOverrated", "jordanrozell", "osufan8184", "teamredandgreen", "xnaas", "MinisterforFun", "estryshak", "Slitted", "meowiie555", "harbenm", "BringBackTron", "lemonviking", "Charboo2", "Panaka", "MobileRadioActive", "desideratas", "ReliantG", "dede_glove", "ShezaEU", "AIienreborn", "CosmicVader", "Yorktown2016", "None", "fiftyfiive", "None", "Snuhmeh", "bale11rm", "geforce_is_force", "Annie_May_001", "windowsphoneguy", "osufan8184", "buzzkillr2", "Chaasel", "gunsnricar", "chrisjcon", "_DeadshotAce", "yungstevejobs", "p13t3rm", "GIFSec", "FezVrasta"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 566, "num_comments": 101, "title": "Twitchy AppleTV App is officially dead.

That just makes for a bad UX because it makes the entire interface feel like one giant advertisement.\n\nWe see this problem across the tech world - from YouTube to Netflix to Apple Music and now the Apple TV app - and I think we need to see a shift in focus. Curation should be a feature, not the entire paradigm around which an app is built.\n\nHere's what I mean: **[Curation Should Be A Feature, Not A User Interface](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/curation-should-be-a-feature-not-a-user-interface-ae52384bc30c)**\n\nThis has been terrible for several years now with regards to Apple Music, and now the same issue is popping up with the emergence of Apple TV.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**Here's how Apple TV should work:**\n\n**Apple:** *Hey, we've got this great new TV app that functions as a repository for all your content. You pick and choose what 'Channels' you want, you order them within the TV app, and the TV app functions as a central repository for all your content, all organized in one unified UI that's accessible via any of your Apple devices and controllable via Siri. You sign up for Channels, those media companies get paid, and we get a cut of that for providing the unified service, just like with our App Store model. Oh, and we'll throw in our own TV+ channel for free, as a perk to entice you into this TV ecosystem!*\n\n**Users:** *Awesome! Here are the 15 shows I want to watch! I'll order all the services I need in order to get those 15 shows, and then you'll provide a UI where I can track and watch those 15 shows!*\n\n**Apple:** *Will do!*\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBut that's not how it works. The \"Watch Now\" tab is a complete mess, with everything from every streaming service (including TV+) being thrown at you like a series of ads. I think what **SHOULD** happen is the \"Up Next\" functionality should be dramatically expanded and given its own tab, so that it functions like I highlighted above - you add the shows you're watching and it functions like one of those TV show tracker apps, to keep track of everything you've watched, allowing you to rate each episode, telling you when the next episode airs, and of course, allowing you to watch it.\n\nThe \"Watch Now\" tab will continue to exist, but maybe it can be renamed \"Browse\" or \"Recommendations\" so that it continues to curate and recommend content for you. But once you see things that interest you, you'd add them to the new tab, which can be called \"Collection\", or maybe even the \"Library\" tab could be converted into this.\n\n**tl;dr - The Apple TV app should add a new tab in which you can add all the shows across all streaming services/'Channels' you want, and you'd have a UI that functions like one of those TV tracker apps, listing all the shows you're currently following, your progress, your ratings for each episode, the next air dates, and of course, allowing you to watch the next episode.**", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "drm8tb", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/drm8tb/this_is_quite_possibly_the_single_biggest/", "author": "heyyoudvd", "children_name": ["None", "KillaMarci", "xtremevicky", "SupremeGodzilla", "modernboy1974", "AUGA3", "CosmicOwl47", "megablast", "isaacc7", "fatboyslick", "u1tra1nst1nct", "PeaceBull", "ClockworkAeroplane", "ericbm2", "Claydameyer", "MyBoggartIsABoggart", "TimFL", "chaiscool", "Greyboxforest", "Fredifrum", "LAnormal", "KingKontinuum", "chemicalsam", "martyjmclean", "James_Fucking_Holden", "flekkzo", "dentistwithcavity", "cerebud", "dnkndnts", "wankeyy", "scarabic", "d7mtg", "space_olympian", "jfoughe", "Mixon696", "Hybridjosto", "nivkj", "panda_bear_", "thatfool", "solefaqscmo", "Sanibel-Signal", "Cpt_SteveRogers", "feeblemuffin", "TheMoistestWords", "Level1000Programmet", "d1358166", "rajanphadnis", "uCry_iLoL", "YouCanadianEH", "ieatpineapple4lunch", "Ravcharas", "EzekielGoldman"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 156, "num_comments": 118, "title": "Anyone else feel like the Airpods are MORE comfortable than the Airpods PRO?", "selftext": "Just got the airpods pro over the weekend and after sometime in the ear, it hurts.\n\nI want to love the pro but the regular ones are so much more comfortable.\n\nanyone else feel that?\n\n\nEdit:   By day 2 of avg use, they seem to get more comfortable.

I then immediately hopped on a flight from the US to Hong Kong - here are my thoughts:\n\n**COMFORT**\n\nYESSSSSSSSSS this is what I\u2019ve been dreaming of! I hated the big headphones when trying to rest my head against a pillow trying to sleep. I hated the AirPods falling out and me having to search the floor and my seat for them when I wake up and realized they were gone. I hated the QC20s because I would get tangled up in the wires. \n\nThis is what I was looking for. Thank you, Apple.\n\n**NOISE CANCELLATION**\n\nOk so this is why we\u2019re all here, right? Noise cancellation was incredible. Honestly incredible. They were on par with the QC35s, and in some aspects, better. I found that it cancelled the background hum very slightly better than the QC35s, and also better at cancelling out voices - though I think this was more the isolation part than the active noise cancellation. With the Bose, if there is a cabin announcement or a flight attendant is talking to me, I\u2019m usually aware of it enough to be able to know it\u2019s going on and take off my headphones. With these, honestly, I often found myself not even aware - they were that good. \n\nProbably a flight attendants nightmare, but I did find myself being able to see when they were going through the aisles and put it into transparency mode. \n\nOne big difference with noise - with the Bose, during takeoff, on some of the planes/engines that I fly (I fly 200k miles a year), I find that the noise cancellation doesn\u2019t work well and it ends up making an awful noise for a few seconds, to the point where I sometimes have to take them off. There\u2019s just some frequency that it doesn\u2019t like. This was not an issue with the AirPods Pro. Additionally, when I rest my head against the side of the airplane to sleep with the Bose, the vibration often caused noise in the Bose. Not an issue with the AirPods Pro since they don\u2019t stick out enough to hit the side of the plane. \n\n**USAGE WITH IFE**\n\nOkay so this part is a bit more annoying. With the QC35s, I can just plug them into the IFE. For this, I had to use Twelve South\u2019s AirFly. It works. It\u2019s another thing to carry around and keep charged. But it works. \n\n**BATTERY LIFE**\n\nOOOOOOOkey. So here\u2019s where things go south. Battery life is dismal. A fully charged set, brand new, lasts 4.5 hours. My flight, after including boarding, taxi, takeoff, and landing, was well over 16 hours. That\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s unrealistic to get a 100% charge - in reality, it won\u2019t be ever really fully charged since it charges much faster at lower %, and you\u2019d have to wait much longer for a full charge than a 80% charge. So, on a 16 hour flight like mine, you\u2019d have to charge like 5 times - and that\u2019s what I did.\n\nThankfully, the charge time is relatively fast. I put it in the case every time I got up to go to the bathroom, and it wasn\u2019t too bad. It would drop down to 10%, I\u2019d get up to use the bathroom, walk around, stretch, get back and it\u2019s charged to 50%. Workable, but really not great. It also means that you can\u2019t keep listening to your entertainment while walking around the cabin, which I liked doing. \n\nI wish they had made it a bit longer like the original AirPods and improved the battery life instead. \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nOkay so what does this mean: for short/medium haul flights, such as domestic USA flights, this replaces my Bose QC35. Period. I\u2019m leaving that bulky case at home from now on. \n\nFor long haul flights... it\u2019s a bit tougher of a sell with the battery life where it is. On my flight here, I left the Bose in the case other than for the direct comparison, and it was a bit of a hassle. If the QC35 batteries die, you can still use them sans noise cancellation. If the AirPods Pro die, you\u2019re SOL. I think for trips where I\u2019m concerned about packing light, I\u2019ll forgo the Bose for the AirPods Pro, but if I have the space to spare, the Bose will still stay with me.", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dqcvsn", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dqcvsn/airpods_pro_vs_bose_qc35_on_a_15_hour_flight_my/", "author": "Forty_Too", "children_name": ["xuki", "Cocoapebble755", "None", "iloveyou271", "Michaelanthony87", "Clementt", "bigspottedcat", "nextinteraction", "Davidclabarr", "david_chi", "busa1", "momo1083", "Jeremiareyes", "Yaaaayyy", "Automayted", "darkwaves", "Nochinnn", "ProbablyOnPSFour", "floprg", "l0ug33", "coincasanova", "TheKobayashiMoron", "z6joker9", "590264", "elkend", "elthrowawayoyo", "cr8tvt", "spasserkongen", "choff5507", "Aarenas52", "remoh99", "DevinOlsen", "rich6490", "gauz47", "Banelingz", "DeandreDeangelo", "Marnix193", "luk8ja", "RenegadeUK", "MashedPotatoShole", "nerdpox", "isoplayer", "dellfanboy", "supremecookeh", "ademord", "goldenshower47", "sparse1234", "nightfly13", "bryceplatt", "graymountain", "KingTurboFox", "thenightmancommeth88", "OnlyForF1", "BornUnderPunches", "cruzlilun", "buangsaja", "Tesla_UI", "GalantisX", "lolboahancock"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 702, "num_comments": 112, "title": "SOURCES: Apple's Pizza Is Very Good", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dq9o8j", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dq9o8j/sources_apples_pizza_is_very_good/", "author": "tits_for_tots", "children_name": ["not_right", "rprebel", "FizzyBeverage", "soliloqium", "HatoriiHanzo", "emt139", "caliform", "yelow13", "dank414", "twistedweasel", "burgonies", "NateyOnPC", "Zachavelii", "epmuscle", "iamsebj", "TheMacMan", "LogicalStats", "SubjectWarning", "mattryanharris", "R-code", "ericchen", "BoxAfterDark", "jefenation", "kinglucent", "epictetvs", "EwoldHorn", "Northern_Nine", "random_user_name_759", "ubsunkeys", "afterburners_engaged", "msabre__7", "BronzeEast", "Mixon696", "Gmedic99", "Evning", "got_killed", "rsn1990", "luciferteets", "fodnick96", "ImOnRedditMaaan", "Clipper9", "doge_is_wow", "esmori"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 951, "num_comments": 231, "title": "Apple Airpods Pro Live at Costco - Ships 11/11 - $234.99", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dq83g6", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dq83g6/apple_airpods_pro_live_at_costco_ships_1111_23499/", "author": "justcodeit", "children_name": ["DeepFusion", "Swastik496", "Vihzel", "wolfchuck", "LobstaChowda", "Memelord370", "aa2051", "SoCalBadger", "pwnedkiller", "mister_foobar", "y3rnaux", "MMMpatient", "fenbekus", "ColdAsHeaven", "Daniel-Tiglao", "None", "MightBeObama", "wooddude64", "scoobydoopyy", "PapaSmurf22_", "Gaary", "Gaary", "PumasUNAM7", "krystopher", "Memelord370", "Syonoq", "accurrates", "wooddude64"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 376, "num_comments": 134, "title": "Other than the Mac Pro, Apple may be done with hardware releases for 2019", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dqc5v6", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dqc5v6/other_than_the_mac_pro_apple_may_be_done_with/", "author": "Lenininy", "children_name": ["RedGreenBluest", "DMacB42", "Ricky_RZ", "fishbert", "dust4ngel", "RentalGore", "martyjmclean", "ersan191", "heyyoudvd", "996forever", "sportsfan161", "Whyevenbotherbeing", "danielisverycool", "Nexus03", "KingLuis", "voigtstr", "Taizette", "Solid_Snark", "TheJadedSF", "None", "PM-ME-UR-PVT-KEY"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 19, "num_comments": 273, "title": "Daily Tech Support Thread - [November 02]", "selftext": "\n\nWelcome to the daily Tech Support thread for /r/Apple. \n\nHave a question you need answered?

New top spec iPhone every year new top spec work MacBook Pro laptop every 3.5 years...I have the OG iPad Pro...daily Airpod user...I believe in Apple products and rely on them daily in my professional and personal life.\n\nI was hoping these were going to be announced at the iPhone event in September.  Announcement hits that Airpods Pro are out earlier this week, and they were an instant preorder for me.  They arrived on 10/30.  I was so hopeful, these would be 'the ones'.\n\nBit of background: My Airpods are my goto when traveling around the city and for multiple work calls a day.  I truly believe that as a phone headset, there is nothing that comes close in the wireless domain.  I've learned to accept the audio quality for music, but the Airpods (2nd gen), are not going to 'move' you from an audio quality perspective, and I am totally fine with that.  I have other headphones (wired and wireless that I use when I want top notch audio quality)  Phone/business calls first, music second for this device...but due to sheer convenience they are in my ears more than any other headphones I own by a massive margin.\n\nHere is my honest review of the Airpods Pro:\n\n1. The case is about 10% larger, noticeable in close fitting jean pockets, this is an obvious one and easy to deal with\n2. It is more than 'just a bit' more challenging to remove Airpods Pro from the new case.  I struggle to not drop them in a serious way versus the previous case and form factor.  I have similar problem putting them back in, the previous form factor was just robotic, in/out, boom no problems.  The way they fit in the case almost feels like it's the reverse of the way it was previously. This is a real tough one for me.\n3. I believe I am in between the small and medium tips, size wise.  The ear tip test, passes for both small and mediums tips for me, yet there is a noticeable improvement in sound (music and calls) quality with the small tips.  The sounds is quite a bit improved over Airpods, but after 10ish mins of wear time, they seem to not maintain a tight seal.  Medium's remain tight but the sound quality is noticeably inferior and more 'tinny' and similar to the airpods.  Another tough one for me, but not a universal issue.\n4. I ride my bike, and boosted rev with my Airpods in...the play/stop and skip functions are all accessible by simply single or double tapping the Airpods...the new mechanic of having to grab on to the stem is much, much more cumbersome, and clumsy, especially when moving.  Previously just take your knuckle and tap away.  This existing mechanic wins by a long shot over the stem squeezes.\n5. NYC winter is approaching, gloves are required.  The stem mechanic becomes then again more clumsy with gloves on, I've tested this with my biking gloves (very little bulk to these gloves) and while it's workable, it's inferior to the previous generation and with more bulky gloves getting that stem press just right is challenging\n6. The sound quality is definitely improved throughout the spectrum...lows still leave you wanting, but mids and highs are improved over the Airpods...At 250 dollars you are at the same price point of another pair of in ear full wireless: The Sennheiser Momentum true wireless which have magically wonderful sound quality, but are really not so great when talking on the phone.  Yes they are large, and can get uncomfortable after extended wear, but they are the top IMO for in ear true wireless audio quality.  I digress.\n7. Noise cancelling is really quite good.  Transparency mode is cary good.  I own the Sony WH1000XM3 and it's tough to compare Airpods Pro to over the ear ANC cans, but I'm happy with the active noise cancelling and with the transparency mode, transparency mode is astonishingly good, to the point it feels like you have super hearing.  I was ordering food with transparency on, and while in line, could very distinctly hear a conversation a customer was having with the cashier 10-15 feet away from me.  I would likely put the transparency mode of the Airpods Pro in a tier slightly above the XM3s.\n8. The shorter stem length is nice aesthetically, but really lacking functionally.  The beauty of the long stems on the Airpods was you could so quickly just snag them out of your ear.  Walking down the street in NYC and someone comes up to you asking for directions...fumbling with the squeezing stem mechanic, or using your phone to turn on transparency is awkward and not instant...plucking the airpod out of your ear by the stem is instant.\n\nMost of the issues I'm experiencing are mostly coming from the previous generation.  Perhaps if you did not use the previous generation day to day, much of this would be non-relevant.  My guess is a large portion of consumers are coming from the previous generation though.  Rock and hard place as to whether or not I will keep them at this point.\n\n\\*formatting edits\\*", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dqa9tf", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dqa9tf/airpods_pro_an_honest_and_lengthy_review_from_an/", "author": "dnorm00", "children_name": ["anony-mouse99", "Read_That_Somewhere", "robby_c137", "bussy1847", "Joseph-07", "RentalGore", "gjc0703", "Mayucchi", "parkertim", "z6joker9", "captainsmudgeface", "wino6687", "Bakzz64", "totally_not_griffin", "dukwrth", "livininafantasea", "Toliver182", "NoxTempus", "chrislstark", "szzzn", "billk711"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 567, "num_comments": 400, "title": "Apple TV+ Is Out!

Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/FkBRRAm\n\nLet's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:\n\n**Active Noise Cancellation**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **7/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **N/A** \n* WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8/10**\n* WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10/10**\n\nHands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect.\n\n**Sound Quality**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **7/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **8/10**\n* WF-1000XM3: **9.5/10**\n\nThe in-ear Sony's win this one easily - the sound is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. Sony nailed the audio quality on these, whereas the Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1/2.\n\n**Comfort**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **9/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **6.5/10**\n* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**\n\nThe shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them.\n\n**Battery Life**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **7/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** \n* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**\n\nNot very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge.\n\n**Connectivity**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **10/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** \n* WF-1000XM3: **7.5/10**\n\nBoth the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone.\n\n**Call Quality**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **9/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **5/10** \n* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**\n\nAirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here.\n\n**Case Size/Pocketability**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **9.5/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **3/10** \n* WF-1000XM3: **5/10**\n\nWhile slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable.\n\n**Workout/Gym**\n\n* AirPods Pro: **8/10**\n* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** \n* WF-1000XM3: **7/10**\n\nPersonally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder.\n\nUltimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality.\n\nHope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpqopb", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpqopb/airpods_pro_vs_powerbeats_pro_vs_wf1000xm3_bonus/", "author": "frumpy_cat", "children_name": ["Abcmsaj", "WankasaurusWrex", "Cephrael37", "vjyrshn", "gorkt", "DarkReference", "harrybeeee", "1legendd", "71-HourAhmed", "MarlinFF", "TheBoardGamer", "PhoKingClassic", "poksim", "nachobel", "Godvater", "Wizerud", "itscrazouthere", "aywhosyodaddy", "21Savvy", "thisisreadonly", "Mxbzz", "Baryn", "stefwnmk", "ralphiooo0", "cubercaleb", "lima432122", "maximilianyuen", "xAlphamang", "d7mtg", "mattyuh_", "annirosec", "CrazyMoFo3000", "Imnothighimretarded", "JamminJerome", "boyobo", "iloveyou271", "boogoobear", "Throwawaynyc37273", "Sap1l", "Nochinnn", "faqsham", "liquidchambers", "TrumpBOOER", "xtremevicky", "SuperiorArray", "cercant01", "burstaneurysm", "rippinkitten18", "dhp1161", "JimmyNo83", "dxrebirth", "Deadmine", "Slitted", "GraciousMonkey123", "None", "DexterP17", "avesh6994", "CuriosityRulz", "avesh6994", "Nineand5", "afc74nl", "phunk-phreak", "Wgsx", "ericksontx", "stupornatural", "the-holocron", "falconsfan55234", "dg1974it", "lamchinb", "chodaniel", "kaspal", "raptor2569", "JuliusCes", "rohansamal", "flynnsarcade", "Graphics_Nerd", "bugsysiegals", "graymountain", "SpaceSlingshot", "Norrosord", "Choju_Jansen", "IamNotaPro870", "scarletspe3dstr", "EzekielGoldman", "PupRush", "hypeboss", "aCuria", "None", "IntellectualBurger"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 388, "num_comments": 92, "title": "Apple TV+ set to release at 12:00am (Pacific Time) on November 1", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpvpq4", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpvpq4/apple_tv_set_to_release_at_1200am_pacific_time_on/", "author": "pattrivedi", "children_name": ["aaronp613", "Dogmatron", "zzzman82", "None", "None", "caspararemi", "zzzman82", "TheMasterDingo", "j_tosavetheday", "BronzeEast", "Officerjackbaur", "Mr_Incredible91", "wolfensteinlad", "None", "jayplus707", "Schrodingers_Moose", "Silvedoge", "omnifidelity", "marwanjukka", "20nuggets", "RuRu92", "gustafh", "ameyalive", "Blowout777", "pitterposter", "bawangciaga", "t3hWheez", "freebluespike", "Sirjohndeere1", "ithinkoutloudtoo", "throwingitallaway33", "kellie0105", "mattpen87", "abaddon2025", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 6, "num_comments": 120, "title": "Daily Tech Support Thread - [November 01]", "selftext": "\n\nWelcome to the daily Tech Support thread for /r/Apple. \n\nHave a question you need answered?

I have been using the Sony WF-1000XM3 since august and are very happy with them except for connection quality, which sometimes stutters.\n\nSOUND QUALITY  \nThe Sonys wins this one I'm sorry to say. The base is much better and the whole soundspace seems bigger and \"roomier\". But the Airpods Pro are still miles ahead of the old airpods, though. All in all they have a very nice sound and I am going to sell my Sonys and use the pros as my only in-ear set.\n\nNOISE CANCELLATION   \nThe Airpods Pro wins this one. They really surpriced me here. I was expecting them to be near the Sonys but IMHO the are better. They completely cancel out the aircon/motor of my car inside the cabin where as the Sonys cancels most of it but still leaves a faint hiss. I would go as far as saying they are very close to my over ear Bose QC35s, which is really really impressive for such small devices.\n\nFIT & Comfort  \nThe Airpods Pro wins by a mile here. The Sonys make a tight seal but also gives you the feeling of being inside a bubble. When I first put the Airpods in my ears i though I hadn't pushed them \"into the ear\" far enough. They felt very light and almost like they weren't in the ear. But then the ANC kicked in and it was complete silence, but with the strange feeling of NOT having something stuffed into your ear canal. VERY impressive, Apple.\n\nTRANSPARENCY & AMBIENT SOUND MODES  \nAgain - the Airpods wins here. With the Sonys on Ambient Sound mode they let outside noise in, but if you're trying to have a conversation with someone it sounds strange. My own voice is \"off\" and i find myself speaking way too loudly to the person in front of me. I always end taking the Sonys out even for short interactions. The airpods on the other hand - maybe because of the airway thing doesn't give you a strange feel and doesn't make your own voice sound weird. I can have a much more natural interaction with a cashier or make a short remark to a coworker.\n\nTLDR; Sonys have (IMHO) slightly better sound, but Airpods wins out in ANC, comfort and transparency mode, so I'm selling my Sonys and keeping the Airpods. Also - i don't expect the airpods to have connection problems or any lag watching youtube/netflix, like the Sonys do.\n\nHighly recommends the Airpods...", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dppyy3", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dppyy3/my_airpods_pro_vs_sony_wf1000xm3_take/", "author": "Soaddk", "children_name": ["heyyoudvd", "JamminJerome", "aprx4", "AdrianThatGuy", "DANK_ME_YOUR_PM_ME", "dubsteponmycat", "HesiPullOutJimbo", "MikeKlump", "rgr555", "YouCanadianEH", "Bear_2746", "theramennoodle", "Greystache", "LQST", "slicecom", "EzekielGoldman", "bobhammer3", "Baryn", "fill-me-up-scotty", "S5olomon", "giganticcobra", "wicktus", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 387, "num_comments": 132, "title": "Apple Said to Receive 16-Inch MacBook Pro Shipments This Quarter, Launch Timing Remains Unclear", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpnm6z", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpnm6z/apple_said_to_receive_16inch_macbook_pro/", "author": "gulabjamunyaar", "children_name": ["Jphorne89", "walktall", "None", "whtge8", "DomeKaboom", "Aki-Baidya", "jgreg728", "Mr-Dogg", "ekmaster23", "Denlu22", "AutoGeek3000", "damnit_puth", "negru_roa", "BreiteSeite", "DIGITALMVMNT", "CoolBeansOnToast", "stonevil", "wipny", "Someguy2020", "Lenininy", "Evergreen0102"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 615, "num_comments": 318, "title": "Tim Cook claims AirPods pro are complementary to AirPods, not a replacement", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpjl6q", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpjl6q/tim_cook_claims_airpods_pro_are_complementary_to/", "author": "mrmoosepersonman", "children_name": ["Solkre", "kris33", "martyjmclean", "emohipster", "ieffinglovesoup", "Ipride362", "BitterPercentage", "supercharged0708", "ughjustanything", "DreamyLucid", "DrDrangleBrungis", "hrustomij", "-MPG13-", "woodeenho", "yudoit", "OkTale8", "arbiboss", "ToasterToasts", "BornUnderPunches", "bonsai1214", "Fredifrum", "allfort", "HeyRememberThatTime", "Tallkotten", "ReliableSource", "jksahu333", "Justos", "kingofthewilds", "seansolo2k", "zampe", "rgr555", "Mixon696", "David0h", "themariokarters", "Evning", "IceCreaaams", "marcelowit", "ApuSpringfield", "Night-Lion", "jbayne2", "AccidentallyBorn", "Just_Some_Reddit_Guy", "zomedleba", "victuringan", "szzzn", "Fredifrum", "Fredifrum", "jashov", "Fredifrum", "pizzae", "RcNorth", "hojx93", "cbfw86", "jgreg728", "2clickswest"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 1006, "num_comments": 98, "title": "Apple Pay transaction volume growing 4x as fast as PayPal, Tim Cook says", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpgfjq", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpgfjq/apple_pay_transaction_volume_growing_4x_as_fast/", "author": "Aedengeo", "children_name": ["Xelanders", "None", "Whoop-n", "pfishes", "hypebeastvirgin", "xXwork_accountXx", "ChaBeezy", "compounding", "None", "icohgnito", "rjcarr", "ChildofChaos", "officialimicca", "PastaPrimav", "JoeDante84", "FunkrusherPlus", "pitterposter", "garfieldhatesmondays", "Rokkstar007", "wiseminds_luis", "mqtang", "rippinkitten18", "Crotherz", "UleeBoi", "None", "Fabtacular1", "Stazalicious", "1legendd", "hrishabh19", "bradenalexander", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 711, "num_comments": 264, "title": "AirPod Pros feels like walking during the middle of a quiet snowstorm even in NYC.", "selftext": "Living and workin in NYC.

Because... quite frankly \u201cit just did\u201d. Microsoft, Google and others could be seen as only a far-away blur in your review mirror. Steve Jobs ran your company to perfection. And I believe everyone will have to admit, that although people may not have liked Mr. Jobs personally and he may have been tough to work for, during his tenure - Apple products \u201cjust worked\u201d. \n\nNow under Mr. Cook\u2019s tenure, things have changed. While I believe the innovation is still alive and well at Apple, I believe your execution is nearly dead.\n\nFrom bad keyboards, to bricked Homepods, to bad displays, your quality is definitely at an all-time low point.\nIOS 13 is a disaster. Can anyone who has ever met Mr. Jobs when he was alive (I never had the pleasure unfortunately) imagine his response to bricking $300 Homepods and then having to replace them all at no cost?\n\nI know you folks probably don\u2019t read the other (I think they are called sub-reds) very much, but over on r/homekit, there are people who have bought 4 or so Homepods and had them all bricked by iOS 13.2. Over $900 in sales to a single person and you tanked them all. They are not happy and I have to say... I do not blame them one, damned bit.\n\nI personally was going to post a short video which shows my Homekit Home app accessories blinking between \u201cunresponsive\u201d , \u201cupdating\u201d and \u201cunavailable\u201d like some bad sci-fi space-movie set because of iPadOS 13 - but I did not want this letter to seem like simple venting or complaining. It is definitely not. Please understand that it is genuine concern.\n\nI work at a large software company as a Scrum Master to four development teams. And if anything like iOS 13 was released by us, I think we all would be packing our bags. And while I love a good joke as much as the next person, may I very humbly suggest that you should spend a little less time getting Siri to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Mr. Cook, and a little more time on QA\u2019ing iOS 13 and cracking down on your hardware quality control?\n\nI am an Apple devotee, and do not cherish the thought of having Windows 10 running my home automation. I simply can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have to answer the question \u201cAre you sure?\u201d every time I want the fan in my bathroom to go on. Nor do I wish to give up my iPhone, iPad, Homepod or Macbook Pro. But unfortunately you are driving me to consider it. \n\nI know that I am just one person, and your daily sales figures will never miss me as a customer. But please know this... I have been an NFL fan my whole life and NEVER missed a game ( I am 60 now). Three years ago the players started kneeling during the National anthem. And while I fully support the right to protest, I have never watched a game since. Nether the players or the league commissioner apologized for accidentally insulting the brave men and women who protect our country. I know they did not mean to do so, but since they could not be bothered to apologize, I will not watch another game. I do not know who won the last two super bowls and do not care. To me, the NFL is dead. \n\nI believe there may be a few people like me who feel the same way about you folks. We are devotees, and would fully support and stand by Apple through this little bump in the road - but I think you need to do a little, honest admission. You have made a mistake, screwed up a bit and I think a sincere apology by Mr. Cook to the dedicated Apple user group may be in order.

Those audiophile gear are more like luxury watches, sure a luxury watch will be relative accurate, but even a $200 dollar mechanical watch can be just as accurate as a $200,000 mechanical watch.\n\n**That being said, I'm happy to report that the AirPods Pro's sound quality is good enough that it makes no sense to split hairs, it basically sounds the same as the good headphones I own.** I'm not gonna give it a score or anything, I'll just say this, I currently own the Yamaha EPH-200, a fairly good IEM that has balanced sound, relatively flat response, and it sounds almost exactly the same as the AirPods Pro. I also have the AKG Q701, a classic, it sounds very slightly better and I'm not even sure if that's due to the sound or the fact it's around-ear and open. I also have the Beats Solo Wireless 3, it has more bass so the response isn't flat but other than that it again, sounds about the same as the bunch.\n\nThe biggest weakness with most cheaper (but still decent, not like Wish.com counterfeit crap) is bass, and that's because if you power the speaker with the same amount of power and have it make different sounds, it will naturally be weaker in the bass, so usually you need some way to get around that problem, which makes it more expensive. Also the solutions to these problems usually involve inefficiencies, like some IEMs will just put a filter in there to reduce the mids, and make everything louder. Or if you have a big headphone you can put some circuits in there to digitally change the sound so it comes out more balanced. This is why your standard EarPods and AirPods are a bit lacking in bass.\n\nBasically that lack of bass problem is gone in AirPods Pro, so yea that's that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will not address some of the audiophile snake oil you might see online, and first up is **sound stage.** If you don't know that is, well a headphone with \"good\" sound stage makes the music sound like it coming from in front of you, or maybe around you. Where as a headphone with \"bad\" sound stage makes it sound like the music is in your head. You'll constantly hear audiophile snobs talk about this and to be honest, it's a real thing. Problem is, it's just dumb to make a headphone have \"good\" sound stage.\n\nYou see, making a sound, sound like it came from further away is just like adding a filter to an image, like if you make a photo foggy then it looks like the things in it are further away, it's exactly like that, a post-process effect. Since most music are designed to be played back through speakers, they don't have and sound stage effect baked in, so if you just play them through theoretical ideal speakers in your ear, it sounds like the instruments are in your head. So what headphone manufacturers do, is they design their stuff in such a way as to physically introduce distortions that make it sound like it's from further away. This is really a hack, a dumb way to do things because that's like making your phone's display over-saturated to compensate for under-saturated dull movies like Justice league or something, it's dumb because when you want to watch a regular movie, then it would look like crap. Same with headphones with built-in sound stage otherwise known as \"good\" sound stage, if you're trying to watch some VR porn when the sound is supposed to come from right beside your ears or whatever, it won't work as well. And this is why Apple headphones just all have \"bad\" sound stage, since if you want it, it should be introduced in the software, not in the hardware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond problem is how people misinterpret different frequency response curves as \"better\" or \"worse\" sound. Some headphones like Beats just has louder bass and highs with quieter mids, that's its style. If we're being technical, all of these styles are bad, because you're supposed to make the speaker have a totally flat response curve, that means every sound regardless of pitch should have exactly the same loudness. However this is extremely difficult to achieve with any sensible speaker technology, but what ended up happening, is that people have gotten used to the style of certain brands, and think that is \"good\" sound where as everything else is \"bad\" sound.\n\nThis is exactly like Instagram filters, making a headphone that has style is just like making a phone screen that has an Instagram filter burned into it which you cannot turn off, it's dumb but audiophile snobs love that shit. So when anyone tries to make actually close to ideal headphones, nobody buys them because they sound \"flat\" well of course they do, that's how they're supposed to work, flat is the best, because you can always make a \"flat\" headphone sound like anything else with your custom EQ, where as if it's not flat, it's more difficult to revert it with an EQ (but you still can do it).\n\nBasically, whenever you hear an audiophile snob talk about things like mids, lows, highs, treble, extension, they all boil down to the frequency response curve, one graph that describes them all. It's just as senseless as describing a screen with words like \"the blues are very deep and slightly violet\", yea who gives a shit, just compare it to the standard and tell me what the Delta E is?\n\n# Edit:\n\nI believe there\u2019s quirk with this thing, turning on ANC in some cases reduces bass, and this is most likely because the ANC is most effective for low frequency noise, so what happens is the drivers basically used up all of its bass output for ANC and there\u2019s not much left. For best sound quality you still have to be in a quiet room with ANC off. Also I have to stress again, **forming a good seal is essential for correct bass response** with any kind of in-ear earbuds.\n\nWe have a bunch of audiophile snobs trying to put me down here, and you know what you're all welcome as long as you be specific as to what exactly are you disagreeing and why, and I'll reply to all of that. I will not reply to no-effort rants like \"you don't know anything\".\n\nIt's funny how when these guys reply they keep stressing the price, when that's just not very relevant for anything >$100:\n\n[https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4984044](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4984044)\n\n>The results indicate that neither the measured response nor an attempt to objectively quantify perceived quality is related to price.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n[https://seanolive.blogspot.com/2017/02/twirt-337-predicting-headphone-sound\\_17.html](https://seanolive.blogspot.com/2017/02/twirt-337-predicting-headphone-sound_17.html)\n\n>The correlation between price and sound quality is close to zero and, slightly negative: r = -.16 (i.e. spending more money gets you slightly worse sound on average).", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dpar3k", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dpar3k/airpods_pro_sound_quality/", "author": "1096bimu", "children_name": ["JamminJerome", "MissionInfluence123", "-ego", "epik", "Throwaway_Consoles", "Deonight", "xdamm777", "starmiemd", "Seattle2021NHL", "zomedleba", "wwbulk", "macbrett", "Razultull", "toothsayur", "My_Normal_Account", "nerdpox", "-ego", "UniStudRedditor", "ideamotor", "Gaki-San", "chaiscool", "tnhsr", "Whiplash104", "OutPlayAsians", "KomeradObnobs", "aoaaron", "ABrightCyanDog", "audioen", "bspooky", "amd_r9", "Misterbreadcrum", "gjc0703", "dutch00", "turbineseaplane", "MBHockey", "paper9oll", "derektm", "ddinmez", "RedditIn2018", "Astro_Van_Allen", "Bakzz64", "CompetitiveHedgehog", "p00pkao", "defferoo", "wins_lord"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 80, "num_comments": 74, "title": "First impressions of the Airpods Pro after my first night at the gym with them.", "selftext": "Even though I just upgraded my dying Gen 1 Airpods (RIP) to the second gen, I was awfully tempted to get the Airpods Pro. I have been becoming concerned over the level at which I've been having to raise the Airpods up to, especially while at the gym. I picked up the Pros today after work and immediately put them to the test. My gym is relatively small, and tonight was rather busy with probably 30-40ish people there give or take. \n\n\\- I've never liked in ear headphones, or have been able to wear them. They always fall out or give me that strange pressure in my head. I felt that the OG airpods were a perfect fit, which is why I was slightly hesitant on the Pros. After an initial adjustment period, that \"in ear\" feeling went away, and I was left with that same comfortable and secure feeling the OGs have. Only at the beginning did I feel like they had a chance of falling out, but that went away quickly as I ran on the treadmill.\n\n\\- In terms of sound quality, I am no audiophile. I will say it sounds pretty on par with my second gen Airpods. I'm not sure if the quality has improved or I can just hear it clearer with the NC on. If you were happy with the other Airpods, you'll be perfectly happy with these as well IMO. \n\n\\- I opted for the small tips as they felt the most comfortable and best fit for my ears. \n\n\\- There is something very magical about the first time I put them in. In terms of how noise cancellation works - if you're looking for a product to 100% drown out any background noise - you'll be disappointed with these. My best way to describe them is that it puts the rest of the world on \"low mode\", if that makes any sense. I could still hear the clangs of weights as they were moving around, but the humming of the air conditioners, people's conversations and the music in the gym faded away. It drowns out  the world enough that with your music playing, you kind of forget about everything else around you. \n\n\\- I was playing my music at around 55-60% with noise cancellation on, where as normally my other Airpods would have to be about 75-80%. I switched the noise cancellation off in the middle of the workout to see how it felt without it - It's like night and day. Hard to believe I was blasting my other Airpods at such a high level for so long. \n\n\\- I put on a podcast to test, I had to knock the volume up one notch to comfortably hear it. But could still easily listen to it around 50-55% if I wanted. \n\n\\- At the end of my workout when I took them out I realized just how loud the gym was. There was a Zumba class in the room over that sounded like it could double for a night club. With the Pros in I didn't even realize the class had started. \n\nOverall if you're happy with your current Airpods or other NC headphones, I'm not sure these will revolutionize your listening experience. But if you're looking for the simplicity of Airpods mixed with a very solid noise cancellation feature, I think you'll be more than happy. Just don't go in expecting 100% of all other natural sound to disappear completely. If anybody has any other questions please feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer!

It was amazing to hear active noise cancelling without the air pressure seal - it felt like the world just got much quieter instead of the extremely isolating feeling of the Sonys. In some situations (bus driving by on the street, very loud subway noise) the isolation was better in the Sonys but I was shocked how closely the AirPod Pros come.  In day to day situations (sitting at a desk) they are much better because of the comfort. The passthrough mode also works very well, I could easily hear anyone talking to me (to the level where it was not awkward in a coffee shop - whereas with the Sonys the passthrough wasn't quite good enough to hold a conversation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall I am very impressed with the noise cancelling in these. They took out fan noise so well that I think they might be quite effective on an airplane. They take out the rest of the spectrum a little bit less than the WF-1000xm3s, which I think is mostly due to physical isolation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real reason I am going to keep these is the case! The size is **so** much more practical than the Sonys, it's ridiculous. They are so much more comfortable carrying around and using walking around a city.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: In my opinion the sound quality is much less good than the WF1000XM3. The sony buds have crisp sound where every part of a track is clear and punchy. The airpods, not so much.

Tested w/a few bass-heavy tracks and they get the job done but are nothing extraordinary. OTOH, Jabra 65t's have noticeably better sound quality than the Airpods Pro\n* Call quality was on par w/Airpods\n* Out-the-box the left pod had 85% battery, right had 54%, and the case was at 50%\n* I have not had an opportunity to *truly* test the ANC but in a controlled environment it felt fine. However, as a frequent flier, I doubt their ability to knock out as much ambient noise as my QC 35's\n\nThese observations took me literally no more than twenty minutes. It is possible in practical use my thoughts will change over longer usage throughout the day. \n\n**Update**: I left for work, walking to the train station, and am currently riding on public transport in Tokyo. Here are some more quick thoughts:\n\n* Standard fishbowl sound when wearing in-ear is not present in transparency mode. This was not immediately noticeable until I walked out and was locking my door. With ANC on there is only a slight fishbowly sound \n* ANC was immediately noticeable as I walked outside. It is very good at removing traffic noise and other average noise you hear when walking outside\n* Transparency mode is great for getting a good sense of what noises are around you while walking around. Turning ANC off completely does the same whereas transparency mode seems to add some amplification, although exactly what it is I could be wrong\n* While waiting at a train crossing, with the standard warning noises of an incoming train quite loud, ANC completely removed all of the sounds \n* On the train itself, all standard noise is completely blocked by ANC. If you have to rely on the train operator to announce your stop, best bet is to use transparency mode or turn ANC completely off\n* No additional noticeable difference in sound quality throughout a variety of musical genres\n\nI will do my best to quickly address any questions anyone may have.\n\n**Update 2**: After coming back home from work I tested the AirPods Pro against the Jabra Elite Active 65t's. I put together a semi-random playlist that would, hopefully, highlight the bass, mids, and highs of each set and give me a better indication of the sound quality of the newer AirPods Pro.\n\nFor anyone interested, here is the playlist I used:\n\n* Blackmill - The Drift\n* Travis King - Beautiful Mind\n* Jack White - Love is Blindness\n* Disturbed - The Sound of Silence\n* Dash Berlin - Coming Home\n* Armin van Buuren vs Shapov - The Last Dancer\n* Metallica - The Unforgiven\n* Armin van Buuren - Wild Wild Son\n* Edge of Infinity - Crop\n\nWhen testing the AirPods Pro I *enabled* ANC, and for the 65t's I *disabled* passthrough. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison but as close as you can get.\n\nAfter this testing, and using them for a considerable amount of time today during public transportation commuting and at work, I actually have to reconsider my *initial thoughts* on the AirPods Pro sound quality. I found them to sound considerably better than the OG AirPods, and even better on the mids and highs than the 65t's.

The ear pieces snap onto the AirPods which makes it both scary to remove (you have to pull hard) but also legitimizes the cost of replacement that Apple has listed. They also won't fall off like many third party options!\n2. The sound check should be performed with the smallest pieces attached first if that is what you are used to. Both small and medium tips worked for me during the sound check, but I always prefer smaller. Don't assume that a positive check with medium tips means small won't work. Has anyone had a failed check yet?\n3. They come with a USB-C to Lightning cable!\n4. I still find them somewhat uncomfortable when they sit in my ears for a long period of time, similar to my experience with the previous generation AirPods.

It is always the same letters - \"b\" . and \"n\".  I don't know why it happens - the usage pattern is normal and I don't normally eat over the laptop. Apple has been repairing that with a complete top-case replacement every time.\n\nThe \"b\" key has failed again, and this time the Genius Bar is refusing a free replacement, saying that the keyboard service program has limits - even though this is not public information (which they acknowledge) - there is nothing about repair limits on [their website!](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks).\n\nHere is the written proof (Genius Bar work authorization): https://imgur.com/a/wAcFl5s \n\nThey \"generously\" offered 50% off an estimated $450 repair, which to me isn't enough - it is supposed to be free. \n\nI couldn't find any information online about other clients encountering that limit.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this many failures and faced that limit in the repair program? Is it a real policy aspect, or an excess by a particular store? Was it always likely that, or is it something new? Shall we make this more visible and inform the broader community?\n\nBasically, Apple has designed and produced a defective laptop. It isn't even 3 years old. It's keyboard so unreliable that I had to get and keep around an external keyboard (to support me temporarily when one key on the main keyboard suddenly dies) and a substitute laptop (to use while that one is on repairs). And after all that, they are requiring me to pay for the next repair. That's outrageous.\n\n**Update**: after 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life spent on the phone with the Apple Care phone line (of which 20 minutes being an initial hold and 10 min waiting for a Senior Adviser), they submitted a request to some other department to replace the entire MacBook with a new one (2018). The call went pretty amicably and i did not have to argue much (after being escalated to the senior adviser), just sooo sloooow... The request should be approved in a couple days - hopefully.\n\nThe agent has confirmed that the \u201ckeyboard service\u201d program has its limits. But there is ANOTHER program of full device replacement when apple can\u2019t figure out and fix the problem after 2-3 repairs (for any problem, not just keyboard related). So the rep must build a case to that department so that they reviewed it and hopefully approved. \n\nThat other program though is internal to Apple and somewhat discretionary,  not posted publicly, and does not guarantee approval.", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "doch9a", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/doch9a/macbook_keyboard_replacement_program_limited_to/", "author": "spgremlin", "children_name": ["oldfashionedglow", "Yousefer", "Prof_Redd1t", "CaptainK17", "TinyMammal", "stockholm_sloth", "ammo_john", "alpherah", "sam712", "ozumado", "ShezaEU", "Redwoodsilouette", "kleptomana", "LobstaChowda", "Jeremiareyes", "goocy", "sphexie96", "MusaEnsete", "StaffroomFruit", "Blue-AU", "4iamking", "florianinnocente", "dust4ngel", "None", "windude99", "-jie", "theobserver_", "bro2017"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 187, "num_comments": 59, "title": "Apple Revamping Smart Home Efforts After Falling Behind Amazon, Google", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "doap03", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/doap03/apple_revamping_smart_home_efforts_after_falling/", "author": "crushed_oreos", "children_name": ["JDgoesmarching", "enVoco", "In_Dust_We_Trust", "ssdonatello", "flamepants", "vladmech", "Mr-Dogg", "yourfriendsaccount", "diddlyiddly", "barkerja", "Gareth321", "NET_1", "cmorgasm", "jazzy_handz", "GLOBALSHUTTER", "HilliTech", "ithinkoutloudtoo", "LongjumpingSoda1", "ahboyd15", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 78, "num_comments": 146, "title": "How\u2019s everyone else\u2019s iPhone 11 maximum capacity?", "selftext": "Mine is at 98%.

longtime Apple user, at least since 2004. I was the guy who got the first iPhone, then upgraded every two years to a new device.\n\nThe last new iPhone I bought was a 7. After a year of using it, I moved back to an SE - the size of the 6-and-later phones is just too big. I\u2019m slight. I spend a lot of time in the mountains. Having an iPhone 7 in my pocket (and in a case) is just profoundly uncomfortable.\n\nI\u2019ve been using and loving my SE for well over a year, no complaints. And I was very, very excited about iOS 13. Dark mode! Low data mode! New share sheet! Long-press contextual menus!\n\nBut fuck. iOS 13 has made my phone almost unusable. The battery drains 40% in an hour. The UI is glitchy. I have to turn off cell data every time I leave the house. My AirPods have started skipping and will just...quit working until I unpair and re-pair.\n\nI\u2019ve reinstalled the OS. I\u2019ve done a hard reset. I\u2019ve tried everything, and it\u2019s just not working. iOS 13 is deeply unsatisfying, despite the simple pleasure of new features. Apple should *never* have released iOS 13 in this state, at least up to 13.1.3,  and certainly not to older phones. Forty percent in an hour?! That\u2019s untenable.\n\nThis is the first time in my relationship with Apple that I\u2019m deeply frustrated bordering on angry. Naturally, there\u2019s no chance in hell I\u2019m moving to Android as A) I require a level of security for my work that Android cannot reliably provide, and B) Android UI is way more of a mess than anything in iOS 13.\n\nSo here I am. I don\u2019t want to sound entitled, but I know I do when I say that Apple should never have shipped anything less functional than 12.4. Don\u2019t make updating your phone to new software *feel like a mistake*, Apple! Fucking release features *when they are ready*, not rushed to meet some deadline that you yourself created!\n\nThis next year will be make or break for me. I\u2019m all-in on Apple\u2019s stance on privacy and usability, but they need to start living up to those expectations. \n\nAnd yeah, yeah, I know, but *make a fucking smaller phone next year*. Ordinarily, I\u2019d say the market would handle this, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s really anywhere else to go.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping iOS 13.2 brings some changes. \ud83c\udf7b\n\n\nUpdate: [Well... ](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apples-ios-132-release-bricks-homepod-for-some-users) I\u2019m waiting for someone here to tell me that I should be happy only one of my HomePods was bricked by iOS 13.2.", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "do42h3", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/do42h3/ios_13_is_the_first_time_ive_really_disliked_apple/", "author": "BurnKnowsBest", "children_name": ["Kyahuabhai", "iwasborntoodeep", "MisturMega", "Pretentious_Fella", "oVerboostUK", "Level1000Programmet", "Solkre", "Anon_8675309", "Abstractt_", "jakgal04", "jazzy_handz", "jmnugent", "david_chi", "None", "Deviso", "Boomshakalaka33", "-Gh0st96-", "evo98custom", "guyaneseboi23", "Yakapo88", "None"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 312, "num_comments": 166, "title": "Privacy on iPhone \u2014 Simple as that \u2014 Apple", "selftext": "", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "dn4mxw", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/dn4mxw/privacy_on_iphone_simple_as_that_apple/", "author": "RobertAPetersen", "children_name": ["nondece", "drool-nicotine-slum", "ca_work", "SJWcucksoyboy", "superchunked", "warlun", "tperelli", "CyberConCoder", "iwantaMILF_please", "neloc1", "JWHtje", "chanaandeler_bong", "killingmylonely", "Naughty_smurf", "popypoplandpoppopy", "bearinsun", "fxgod", "foreignsaintboring", "fortuna_cookie", "None", "u_w_i_n", "msh_45", "jazzy_handz", "frumpydrangus", "None", "Icegodd", "Gmedic99"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 31, "num_comments": 76, "title": "[Self Promotion Saturday] Introducing Email Me App, the fastest way to record your thoughts, to-dos, and follow-ups when you're on the go, either from your phone or your watch.", "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI'm Manuel and I've been building Email Me in my free time for the last couple of years.\n\n**Email Me** it is the easiest and fastest way **to email something yourself** so you will never forget things again.

I've told friends and family about this, and a few coworkers knew about this as well. I've never seen it posted anywhere before, so I figured this would be a good place to share the story. I'm fairly positive this was handled 100% silently and internally by Apple and their temp agency Volt. I don't think there's any reason not to share this publicly, so here it is.\n\nA long time ago, during the iPhone 4 and 4s era, myself and other recent computer science graduates from college took 'Technician' jobs at Apple in Elk Grove, CA, doing repair work on iPhones and iPads. That's what we were *told* it would be anyways; as it turned out it was mainly just 'diagnostic' work, and the 'diagnostics' were tapping the screen to make sure various features were working.\n\nThis was a painfully boring job, and the tests were so poorly designed that we ended up failing probably close to a thousand iPads for wifi problems that actually had no wifi problems at all. There were many other issues with the tests that, to this day, still has me wondering how they managed to be implemented... but that's not what this story is about. I digress.\n\nThe work was divided into stations. The first couple stations would grab the iPhones (or iPads in the iPad line) that came in and factory reset them using iTunes, each station using about 8 computers simultaneously for higher throughput. The rest of the stations down the line would take each phone and test it for a specific function to make sure it was working. Phone calls, speakerphone, wifi, screen issues, etc.\n\nThe work was performed in a warehouse that was fenced in with metal detectors and security all over the entrances. At the time, you were allowed to bring in your phones. If you had an iPhone, you had to register the serial number with security. They would give you a laminated print out with your name and the serial number, and when walking through security you had to show them the print out as well as the serial number on your actual phone. You also had to move the screen around so they could verify it wasn't just a picture of the serial number that you put on the phone.\n\nAttempted theft was surprisingly common. I recall at least a few people that were caught attempting to sneak out iPhones. The most notable of which was the man who put a few phones into his pockets, walked through the metal detector after his shift, and when it went off he dashed for the door in a full blown sprint. Hilariously, *this guy was huge and didn't run very fast at all*, and security got to him *within seconds*.\n\nSuccessful theft also happened. One of my colleagues later admitted to me (after my employment was long over) that he got an iPhone out on his last day of employment by wearing a giant belt buckle and took an iPhone to the bathroom (located inside the secured area) and taped the iPhone to his skin directly underneath the buckle. When metal detectors went off, security would pull out those metal detector wands and scan you down, and if you showed them your belt buckle was setting it off they'd just let you walk through after the rest of your body was scanned. I always wondered if he prepped the night before making sure he was very smoothly shaven so he wouldn't rip out hairs when removing the phone (lol).\n\nNow to the main point of the story: one newer technician who we'll call Dave, about a few months into his 12 month contract, came up with a very creative way to get iPhones out of the building. During this time, none of us knew what was going on, all we knew was that Dave had a station that he really liked working at; the receiving station. For most of us it was the worst station to work at because your speed set the pace for the rest of the line, and it never had any downtime. We almost always just let him have that station. Even when stations were rotated or assigned by management, he usually managed to hang on to that one by talking his way into it.\n\nAs time went on, some of us started realizing that Dave had 2 iPhones he would bring with him in to work, and then take out back through security every day. One of us asked him about it and he said he had a personal phone and a second phone for a side business he was running. A satisfactory answer for us; nobody asked him about it again.\n\nMore months passed, and I got a job offer at another company for a 'real' IT position, and several of the techs hired with me were at the end of their 12 month contract, so there was a sudden rotation in people. A couple weeks after my employment ended, I got a call from one of my former colleagues about Dave. Apparently, one of the new techs was inspecting Dave's work really closely, and noticed that Dave was rooting (jailbreaking) some of the iPhones he was working on, and changing the serial numbers to match the serial numbers on his laminated print outs.\n\nDave would simply walk out to his car with 2 iPhones during lunch, drop them off at his car, walk back in empty handed, and walk back out at the end of the day with 2 more iPhones.\n\nThe tech reported him to management and he was arrested. Apple was quiet about the numbers and details, but those of us who worked that specific line who had been at Apple for a while could put 2 and 2 together, and we knew exactly how long this was going on. Figuring that Dave would have easily been able to steal 4 iPhones a day most days, 5 days a week, over a 3 to 4 month period, the total number of iPhones adds up fast!\n\nLast I heard many years ago, Dave was serving time in jail. If I had to guess, I'd bet he'd probably tell you now that the theft wasn't worth it.", "over_18": false, "stickied": false, "id": "crtmw3", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/crtmw3/the_man_who_stole_over_100000_in_iphones_from/", "author": "master00sniper", "children_name": ["TomLube", "tooloud10", "fsck-y", "HissyMonz", "rico_suaves_sister", "darthjoey91", "Goldwerth", "Random", "fr0ng", "Accidentally_Adept", "prtCoder-prtHuman", "eaglebtc", "MustBeTheJuan", "pan3k", "TorchedPoseidon", "flipflapslap", "ArsonMcManus", "Angelwingwang", "None", "jandetlefsen", "lagrtha", "eddydrizzle", "theRayvenD", "None", "EddiOS42", "camnaz29", "CatRabbit499", "Nissanhog", "nekowolf", "HatoriiHanzo", "VonYugen", "focusx0131", "MohammadTiger", "JustinGitelmanMusic", "None", "ganganipple", "cameron_lensen", "uCry_iLoL", "we_hella_believe"]}, {"subreddit": "apple", "score": 1251, "num_comments": 68, "title": "I might be inviting the \u201cReddit Hug of Death\u201d but I thought I\u2019d share my ~30-year-old Mac SE/30, which is currently hosting a website you can visit right now - URL in the comments", "selftext": "So as noted in the title, there\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019m about to nuke my [poor old Mac](https://i.imgur.com/TczuETy.jpg) with a flood of incoming traffic, but hey, what\u2019s the fun of setting up a web server on a 30-year-old computer if you don\u2019t tell anyone about it? \n\nHere\u2019s the URL: www.rhyal.com\n\nTake a look, sign the guest book at the bottom, and please be patient - it\u2019s not exactly a speed demon, plus Comcast (my ISP) has been a little freaked out about a sudden surge of inbound traffic on port 80 to my home IP address this weekend.
