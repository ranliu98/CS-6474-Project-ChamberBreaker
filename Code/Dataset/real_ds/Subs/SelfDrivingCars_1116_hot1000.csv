It takes us forever to adopt things, 15yrs just isn’t enough time for tech that that isn’t even yet proven.

Remember, Walt Disney (a legitimate futurist) and several others promised flying cars in their decades to come... 2020 Brings in legislation that disallows 15% of Belgian cars in the major cities. With the regulations only getting stricter in the years to come. While it might not be 15 years , I can certainly see a future where privately owned cars are very limited Thanks for sharing! Lutz has some good thoughts but also some out of dated thoughts. Even operating AV in a geofences area within a city is crazy complicated and a ways out. He says that within 3/5 years AVs will be taking jobs and he says that a UBI will eventually be needed when technology is everywhere... but he says that we are far from when UBI is needed. Seems contradictory. He is the most uniformed past his prime vocal person in the industry This is the time to think about how much centralized regulation of our freedom of movement we really want before it’s too late. lmao We won't even have true level 5 in 15 years.

Reasonable predictions show that L4 and up will only be at most 10-20% of the market 10 years from now, and that's just what is being sold new, not considering older cars on the road. There are plenty of 15 year old cars on the road today.

This prediction is at least 15 years too early. It's like he has no idea how things actually work in the US. 

The US doesn't ban old cars from cities now. We don't ban cars without seatbelts, cars without airbags, or cars without modern bumpers. We don't even ban cars that use leaded gas. 

The way the US (and most countries) regulate is by putting requirements on *new cars*, and waiting for the old ones to eventually get replaced. 

Which takes decades generally. 

We saw this approach with airbags, rear view cameras (mandatory in new cars since 2018), and AEB (mandatory in 2022 or 23 in new cars). Even though he was old school combustion engine, he seems awfully smart and can envision the future. May not be exactly on the mark, but may not be too far off.

Pull back (from the heading) == scaling back (from citation)?! I think it's the only play they have. You might have a great self-driving program but that's not good enough, you have to be in the top five at a minimum or you're just throwing good money after bad. Daimler, in my opinion, is making the right call. They'll simply buy self-driving from Aurora. Risky bet pulling back from the industry that doesn’t exist and may never? I can't take this article seriously.

For example:

>In spite of that, for many years I ranked Daimler’s efforts as among the best from major automakers, and the Germans in general began the game ahead of other car companies, except perhaps Tesla.

Mercedes was unequivocally and continue to have the worst effort when it comes to SDC.

Back in 2015 when i ranked all SDC companies. Mercedes was in second to last place, only behind who? you guessed it... Toyota.

Isn't it surprising that Toyota back then in 2014 Toyota said  ""Toyota's main objective is safety, so it will not be developing a driverless car.""  [https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a11236/toyota-of-all-companies-defends-drivers-says-it-wont-build-a-fully-autonomous-car-17192664/](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a11236/toyota-of-all-companies-defends-drivers-says-it-wont-build-a-fully-autonomous-car-17192664/)

Funny thing is that since then Toyota has made a U-turn and will beat even Mercedes with an internally developed Level 2 system that handles on-ramp to off-ramp on the highway (2020 highway teammate).

i can't take people seriously when they make statements like this that are so off. Mercedes were terrible at the CA disengagement report. All the videos of their system was inside a test track or a laughable demo. While you had Nissan going hundreds of miles without disengagement and actually demonstrating their system in real world to reporters.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfRqNAhAe6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfRqNAhAe6c&t=162s)

Also you had Audi demonstrating their highway system to all and any reporter.

And these are all internally developed system, not a system developed completely by Bosch as is the case with Mercedes. Bosch also was apart of my Top 5 worst SDC companies.

>Daimler’s other problem, the problem of many car companies, is that they have taken an “ADAS-centric” approach to development. That means they have taken all they are learning from making advanced driver assist – and again, this is an area where Mercedes was a leader – and tried to have the same teams incrementally improve it on a path to self driving.

No Mercedes was NEVER the leader in ADAS, i can say with confidence that Mercedes to date has written 0 code that has anything to do with ADAS's perception or control in their cars to date. ZERO, NONE, NADA, ZIP, NIL.

Its all fully developed by Bosch. I find it hard to take people seriously who don't know that almost all ADAS systems in production today are outsource completely to Tier 1s and Tier 2s.

For example I can only count in one hand the amount of systems which had software that were developed partially in house. Which is AP 1 (control system developed in house), AP2 (perception and control system developed in house) Supercruise (control system developed in house), Nissan Propilot 2 ( control system developed in house), and I believe BMW's driver assistant pro's control system was developed in house aswell. I haven't done research on the new Hyundai system.

But what does these systems have in common? They are by far the best ADAS system hands down. Its not even close.

Mercedes already use Tier 1s, them using it in the future makes no difference (by the way no legacy tier 1 will ever build a L4 self driving car, EVER! not in 2025, not even in 2030. They are incapable of doing it. ) Their so called Level 4 Valet Parking Garage system that works only on specific garages with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of lidar. That software is yet again fully developed top and bottom by Bosch.

Directed to Waymo, they said: ""We won't have a craft solution"" ... This is huge. Daimler is saying they're too far behind the leaders to warrant staying in the self-driving car race. Can the German car industry survive? This is the key:

And he's right. No company has faced this challenge. Remember, Uber etc lose money and they dont spend a penny on buying, maintaining, or cleaning cars.

>As more cars provide Tesla with valuable real-world driving  data with and without Autopilot, the company’s Neural Net continues to  improve. Indications that Teslas can now recognize animals on the road  as pedestrian obstacles are an encouraging sign that the company’s  vehicles are learning, and they are becoming more proficient with every  update.

Seriously, anyone can download a pretrained object detector model ([YOLOV3 here](https://github.com/xiaochus/YOLOv3) as just one example) and get as good or better performance than what we saw in that small video.  The key parameter isn't ""can it detect animals?""- it's the recall / precision statistics on detection performance across a large statistical sample that matters. How does it handle smaller animals? Cats? Squirrels? 

It would be a kinda funny future if Squirrels were avoided and they intentionally started to fuck with the SDCs. I like how this article acts as if self-driving is just a finite series of checkboxes.  And apparently now we can check off the “detect animals” box.  One more down!  We’re so close now! /s I’m wondering if thermal imaging will be part of the required equipment to reach true FSD, or if it’s even feasible. If they're both recognized as pedestrian, does this mean it might decide to sacrifice pedestrian (human) in order to avoid hitting pedestrian (dog), if it derived that there is better chance of saving the life of pedestrian (dog)? the most interesting thing about Tesla is their ability to automatically detect anomalous situations and have the data sent up to be trained into the dataset. I think Telsa calls this ""project vacation"" or some such. the idea is that the neural net improves while the engineers are on vacation. potentially very powerful, but will lack of 3D pre-mapping or lidar hamstring them? we also don't know how good their software team is, compared to others. Tesla is the biggest ""dark horse"" in this whole thing; very hard to predict how long until they have a usable ""level 4"" system

I understand that with this sort of safety critical tech that it's slow going, and this is a super difficult sensor fusion/computer task to get right, but even a little hint would be comforting. :D Great.  I plan to ask the engineers when management is going to let the early riders or whatever film inside of driverless rides. 😋

Maybe they could bring an executive or manager in that could answer a question like that. Aren’t you Waymo One? Can you get driverless rides? Ever been on one yet? This is super great!  I imagine many of us will have many similar questions.... is there a good way we can consolidate / be efficient?   I’ll work I’m writing up my top questions in a little bit. Top question we all should have is when will the general public be able to download the Waymo app in atleast chandler, AZ and take a ride?

Even a vague answer like “by the end of year ____” would make me happy so I can start preparing my plane ticket purchase Sounds like everyone just cares about ""when can I ride"" or other expansion related questions.

Is there a conflict between A) human driver expectations to make risky maneuvers into somewhat narrow gaps during heavy traffic and B) acceptable risk parameters for the Waymo computer? How many calls a day is the command center handling from stuck Waymos. What's the avg delay time of a stuck Waymo. That's a lot of questions.  Personally I am mainly interested in the ones you put near the end, like ""how many rider-only rides"".

I suspect they may try to hide behind ""we're engineers, only engineering questions"" or something like that on some of them.  We will see.

I am going to ask them about one particular scenario with unprotected turns, latency, risk and stuff related to that scenario.  I have to finish some work and then maybe I will put it in here. >(Please don’t say over 10 million miles)

This post is a great idea, but they'll have a PR flack babysitting replies to ensure they don't stray beyond official talking points. I'd try to get them to talk in general about issues they face and hope some good info slips by PR. For example:

\- What tools do you use to measure safety and how much safety improvement do you need before expanding to all of Phoenix? (Tool talk causes PR hack's eyes to glaze over).

\- You collect much more feedback from real-world public users than anyone else. What kind of issues do riders bring up today, and how does it compare to one year ago?

\- You're on your 3rd or 4th generation of LIDAR. How did you make such large improvements each round, and how many more rounds do you need to reach the cost and performance needed to deploy hundreds of thousands of cars?

\- What features do you foresee in future custom-designed Robotaxis that aren't practical in today's Chrysler Pacificas and Jaguar i-Paces?

\- You progressed from the world's first completely driverless test in Austin in 2014 to regular driverless testing in Chandler in 2017 to daily driverless rides for Early Access riders today. This puts you on pace for \~10% of rides being driverless in 2-3 years and close to 100% 2-3 years after that. Do you see potential breakthroughs that might accelerate this pace?

\- Elon Musk says Tesla will have a million robotaxis by mid-2020. Even if he's six months late as usual, how can you compete with less than 1000 vans? Do you worry about getting left in the dust like Xerox PARC who invented the mouse and graphical user interface only to see Apple and Microsoft win the market?

\- It's impossible to predict breakthroughs. In February 2018 \[NEED ACTUAL DATE\] your CEO forecasted commercial service without safety drivers by yearend. What were the three biggest technical issues behind the delay, and how are you attacking them?

The last three questions are poorly formed, and I wouldn't ask all three. But my goal is to create a general context for discussion and sprinkle in a few hard numbers and/or dates they can push back on (or not) without giving numbers themselves. /u/Mattsasa the AmA just started.

It will be an even better experience for you as Toyota's with TSSP2 (like the new ravs) have a better steering sensor! I have a 19 Adventure with openpilot and it works awesome, though I do have to run the code with custom tuning values.  The stock values makes it ping pong on turns.

I know there is at least one person who has it working on the Adventure trim and has tuned it for improved steering performance. No idea about the auto pilot, but I drive a rav-4 for work.

Idk if they changed it the past few years, but their seats are the one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever sat in.

Pretty decent turning radius though. I have a 2019 Rav4 xle with openpilot. I would not expect much difference between the trim levels when it comes to OP since they all have the same TSS 2.0 stock system. The adventure trim is a little different so its possible its not exactly the same, but I would expect it to be close. I know there are a few adventure owners in the discord so they might be able to provide more information.

The Rav4 is a great car, but with OP I would not trade it for anything. I use it all the time. Conservatively I would estimate I have OP enabled about 70% of the time. 

Here are 2 videos of it in action:

RAV4: totally serviceable car. It’s nicer, from a body control and NVH stand point, than I was expecting. As others have noted the seats can be hit or miss depending on your body type. They’re kinda normally terrible seats. Doesn’t bother me on 1-2hr drives but I feel it on the 5-6hr ones. (Versus a Volvo where 6hrs still feels good).

Once again they think they have an anti-SDC argument, but it ends up making a pretty good case for SDCs

Yes, I can believe that an SDC, when presented with a cow-or-deer at the side of the road, could perform worse than a human at identifying it and predicting behaviour as a result.

But for one thing, that presupposes that both see the thing at the same time, let alone at all. An SDC will be much better than a human at detecting animals in the first place, being equipped with 360 degree cameras, night vision, and immunity to distractions or fatigue. Their reaction time is instant. They can instantly communicate things they see to other SDCs in the area rather than flashing headlights at oncoming drivers and hoping they understand.

Secondly, what exactly are we worried about? Is excessive caution so bad? An SDC can easily have an algorithm where, upon seeing an animal like that, it slows to 50 km/h initially, 30 as it passes the animal, and stops if there is unexpected movement. Or it just stops and makes the driver say ""nah it's ok, proceed"". 

The problem with Uber, which is the brush this article uses to paint all SDCs with, is that they were behind in development and tried to jump ahead by saying ""nah just ignore anything you don't understand"". This isn't a problem with SDCs, it's a problem in engineering ethics, something we still deal with in the boring world of steel construction. If I were to accept something not up to code because the load doesn't exceed yield, so it ""should be fine"", the problem isn't with steel as a building material.",What self-driving cars can’t recognize may be a matter of life and death

1. No tickets EVER! The car won't speed, or ever hit anything so traffic cops will become non existant, no one will ever get a traffic ticket and that will free up SO MUCH MONEY to build charging stations and greenspaces by having to pay less police officers just to do ""traffic patrol"" or whatever. Dont know about where you live, but rookie cops here make 85k a year. So having a couple hundred less of them will save TONS of money.

2. Drinking! Many laws will change, for example, yes, drink behind the wheel, why not? Youre not driving. No more DUIS!

3. People are terrible drivers. Putting liability on the auto manufacturer means the cars have to be safe.

4. NO CAR INSURANCE! Because car insurance covers the PERSON driving the car, and self driving cars won't have any accidents, there will be no need for car insurance as the very small number of ""accidents"" will be totally covered by the manufacturer. Since it is caused by their tech, just like the takata airbag malfunctions were paid for by the manufacturer. Also, this means WAY LESS insurance agents who i have always felt were overpaid for what they do. AWESOME!

5. SAFETY! NO ONE WILL EVER DIE IN A CAR WRECK AGAIN. lets face it. SDCs are computers and thus MUCH smarter than people. Faster reaction time, etc. Every car accident in the world is caused by some kind of driver error and computers dont EVER MAKE ERRORS! does your calculator ever make a math mistake? NO! And thats what SDCs will do. No more accidents at all. 

6. Mentioned earlier drinking, but really, do whatever you want behind the wheel, play on your phone, gameboy, sleep, eat, put on makeup, have sex, watch tv, get dressed for work. All while getting where youre going FASTER AND SAFER.

7. LESS CARS ON ROAD! Well, once all the normies who drive regular cars die in wrecks (because of course they will, they dont have a robot driver) there will be way less cars on the road and everything will be WAY safer, because it's all robots.

8. PAVES THE WAY FOR WIDESPREAD BODY ACCEPTANCE. Well, along with being too lazy to drive, most will be too lazy to do other things and the world will turn into a WALL-E movie scenario where everyone is lazy and overweight. THIS IS THE BEST PART because it will make our whole society more accepting, since EVERYONE will be fat. I know i spend most of my disposable income on food, so once i have to pay less taxes for traffic police and no insurance, I'll have a couple hundred a month to dump into doritos and mountain dew, which is anyone's dream life. 

So, what is everyone else excited about?",SelfDrivingCars,What are you most excited about? Self driving cars.,9," I'm hoping we no longer see cars parked on the side of the road, especially in cities. I’m hoping cities will transform to be more walkable since hopefully autonomous vehicles can park outside the city rather than take up 1/3 of cities

Excited for the possibility that transportation will be free in many instances since certain companies may display ads in the vehicles or pay for rides if you stop at their company along your route

It could transform how older people and younger people live since they won’t be stuck at home unable to drive I don't think there will automatically be fewer cars on the road. the same number of trips are needed, so it's a question of how many trip-miles are removed by eliminating the need to drive around looking for parking and how many more miles people will be willing to drive now that they can just play on their phone or sleep.

the thing I'm most excited about are pooled vehicles. right now, the convenience of door-to-door service is why most people drive instead of using public transit, but ubering everywhere isn't practical/cheap enough. even Uber pool isn't cheap enough. however, removing the driver and having 3 separate compartments to shuttle groups of 1-3 people per compartment could cut the number of vehicle-miles down significantly while still providing a very convenient service. if that kind of service feeds people to/from mass transit, then it could be subsidized as part of the mass transit system, and become nearly free (most transit systems are 60-80% subsidized). that sort of thing may not happen automatically, which is why I hope transit planners will be wise enough to request such services similarly to how transit agencies sometimes hire private bus operators. If you don’t think SDCs will have crashes. Try and divide something by zero on a calculator and tell me what happens.

Insurance will absolutely be useful with self driving, it’s extremely unrealistic to expect perfection. We only really need them to get as good as the human average to be widely adopted. There will still be lots of crashes for a very long time.

Also, the majority of Americans are overweight already, but that hasn’t helped with “body acceptance”. The response of disgust to someone unhealthy is the result of millions of years of selection for it, people won’t stop finding healthy fit people more attractive, just because they themselves are fat. Self driving cars won’t make everyone fat. If anything because driving will be less stressful and free up mental attention, people will be healthier. Fewer cars in general. Most cars spend 95% of their day parked, not in use. If we have self driving taxis, or even if people can send their personal vehicles off to generate money for them by shuttling people around, fewer people will own cars and fewer cars will be parked on the side of the roads. Parking lots could be repurposed as green space or housing. I’m looking forward to this future. [removed] I look forward to used car prices plummeting. Once the self driving technology is perfected, no one will want a dangerous non self driving car. Cars will be worth a fraction higher than their worth in scrap. * More space to build now that 9 out of 10 parking lots are no longer needed.
* Not having to run my kids around for hours every day
* Not having to run most errands anymore
* Reduction in roads as most go one-way and pooled rides are the norm
* New set of architecture norms as roads are no longer the focus of cities and neighborhoods
* Accelerated population exodus from truly rural America to cities. 1 - Go to sleep in my car, wake up in a new city. I would travel a lot more if it were that easy.

2 - Cities are FULL of parking lots. If people aren't parking their cars all day while they work, it will open up a ton of new real estate in urban areas for development and/or living space.

3 - The first step to flying cars is self driving cars. Once the technology is perfected, it'll be a lot easier to imagine them leaving the ground. Cycling and walking will feel much safer. I expect to see less obesity, not more. When people realise they can travel in safety and enjoy the outdoors again as well as not paying Waymo for every trip, they will. I assume freeway driving will be solved long before city.  I look forward to no more truck drivers with road rage or fatigued drivers drifting out of their lane.  (Most truck drivers are great, but a bad one is a huge hazard).  There may be exciting new possibilities for mass transit as well, buses serving more rural areas with greater frequency and feeding into regional train hubs.

I imagine airless tires will be necessary though to make this truly safe. Less cars on the road? How self-driving make for less cars on the road? If anything, people will drive more miles because short plane/train trips can be replaced with road trips where you sleep while the car drives.

No deaths in car wrecks? That's only possible if you ban human drivers, which is fascist. 8.  PAVES THE WAY FOR WIDESPREAD BODY ACCEPTANCE.  


No.  Driving is not exercise.  It is not a physical activity.   Driving a car does not keep you healthy.   Americans already have an extreme aversion to walking any more than about a quarter-mile.    I see plenty of drivers who think that self driving cars are for the lazy because the car is doing all the work.  The car is already doing all the work.   If you want to put in some effort, go out and walk.    


I do think however that driverless taxi service will enable much more pedestrian lifestyles, which may include changes to urban design that make areas more walkable to where people will go from driving 100% of the time, to using SDC taxis for longer trips and walking for shorter.  But that is me being optimistic.  Most people will probably use the SDCs for everything and still avoid walking, even if downtown areas greatly transform. I just wanna sit in the car for like long cross country journeys and read my books or work on my laptop. that would be so amazing :P

 like taking a train, but with a bit more privacy I guess. My grandma would buy a self driving car in a heart beat.

Simply so she can go somewhere else other than being limited to the surrounding area of her flat.

She's not driving any longer, reaction time and all, doesn't see too well anymore either. Her legs still work tho. So she's taking walks around the neighborhood. But she's also limited to that neighborhood, which does get boring.
 

You know like...just drive somewhere and go take a walk there and not the same routes around your flat over and over again. Visit the grand kids, her sister and friends without being dependent on the bus or that somebody drives her. Or just go shopping in some different shops every now and then. The simple things.


Basically more independence and better quality of life for old people. > NO ONE WILL EVER DIE IN A CAR WRECK AGAIN. 

I'm sure cars will be much safer in the driverless future, but to suggest that nobody will ever die again is probably a little too optimistic. Look at the engineering and management failures that we still have with much more highly regulated forms of transportation like rail and airplanes. I am personally optimistic for myself as transportation as a service will allow me to get around much cheaper than car ownership.   I am lucky that I am able to do all my work stuff/grocery store/target/shopping mall stuff without using a car.   Me personally, this is going to involve me saving a bunch of money by doing all my car activities without owning a car or paying for all of the costs of car ownership.    


Now the cultural, societal, and economic changes, which will lag, they will take longer than the technology, but I think by 4-5 years after the launch of TAAS they will be obvious and by 2030 the changes in society will be in full swing.    


The cost of reliable, on demand, point to point transportation will drop drastically.  Right now there is ride sharing, which is expensive, and car ownership, which is also expensive and has a lot of responsibilities with it.   TAAS will be all-electric and drastically cheaper per mile than an existing gasser car (without any carbon taxes applied, which could happen).   People can now pay for rides as they need them rather than paying for huge capital expenses on depreciating assets, insurance costs, fuel costs, vehicle maintenance costs, and storage costs (which in many cities, monthly parking rentals are very expensive).   The poor people will afford to get around to handle their business, lower and middle-income people will not have to sink huge portions of their car ownership (this is especially true for multiple car families, which other than collectors I think will mostly disappear from American society).   Spending money on cars is not a good financial investment, but it is needed because people need to get around.  After TAAS people will not need to spend money on cars unless they are enthusiasts, which is about 10% of the population.   By buying rides people will free themselves of the financial burdens of car ownership,  for lower and middle income people this will allow them to have more cash to save or spend elsewhere in the economy.    


I am excited to see cities transform from prioritizing car traffic and car parking to pedestrian and other uses.  Parking lots will turn into green spaces, high-density housing (which no longer needs several hundred parking spaces per building),  commercial space.   Just within Los Angeles, there is like 100-150 square miles of parking, at 33 people per acre this can house over 2 million people.   I think densities can go much higher than 33 people per acre in places like Los Angeles.   In places with $1M per acre real estate its going to make more sense doing major development vs maintaining parking.    


Its going to take longer, but we are going to see cities rapidly transform and allow for much larger populations to live very comfortably.  As all of the cars will ultimately be EVs, the local air pollution will also get much better.  Smog will mostly be a thing of the past.   I do think this will create more pedestrian-friendly areas and we will see things like major footbridges in cities with very busy streets.  Something like the High Line in New York  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line) Ways that a lot of people can walk around and are separated from the cars that both do not slow down the cars and do not slow down people.","What are you most excited about?

Is this common in the US? I love that he saw it was close to crashing, but stayed the course for science.

With Open Pilot on my civic, I almost never drive next barriers unless there's a decent sized gap between the barrier and my car. Nothing has gone wrong in those situations, but I rather not risk it. This vividly depicts one of the big challenges of computer vision- maintaining good performance in the presence of bright sunlight.  With current machine learning methods, it's not the type of problem that automatically  gets better with more and more training data. What retard state just ends lanes into barriers? >But fortunately I took over just in time

&#x200B;

**Not** about being '*fortunate*'. 

""Taking over in time"" is a **mandatory operating constraint.**

Currently operating with autopilot, it's almost analogous to being the instructor & the car is the student driving. You need to watch & anticipate, 'ghost driving' the vehicle mentally, but in the case of the Tesla also immediately take over steering/braking/acceleration with the appropriate changes required.

&#x200B;

It's so easy to become complacent w/AP, to the point where the time between realizing engagement is required & then assessing+physically responding poses a danger. AP is phenomenal, so good that it concerns me we'll see an increase in incidents/accidents due to too much trust & edge cases that'll fail us. The problem will actually be the human drivers but the media and many consumers will blame the vehicles. I’m most impressed with how quickly you reengage autopilot. An experience like that would shake me up for a bit. I did notice that my tesla freaks out in auto pilot when to sun is beaming down on it You know what wouldn't miss this? Lidar. I never use autopilot in construction zones. I know the computer is following the lines on the road and sometimes, like in this example, or when road lines have been redrawn and the old ones are still really visible, the computer just can’t distinguish. I realize this is incredibly pedantic, but that barrier is plastic.  That said, Tesla shouldn't have hit it anyway. A likely contributing factor is the sun low on the horizon. The camera probably couldn’t see the barrier because of that. And this is why you need LIDAR. Trained optical recognition only works when it's seen that exact scenario thousands of times and learned, it cannot handle new conditions. That could be avoided with a good radar (obviously with lidar as well.) The ones that are used on these Teslas are way old generation and not good enough. At least one forward facing LiDAR should be a regulatory requirement for self driving cars. This is, unfortunately, [not very surprising](https://www.fastcompany.com/40551516/apple-engineer-who-died-in-tesla-crash-had-warned-about-auto-pilot-errors). [So Tesla autopilot basically behaves like this](https://youtu.be/L8MBS_9W3_0?t=137) This is why we need stereo cameras and have robust 3D reconstruction, also we need to stop using just lane markings for any autonomous mode.
This approach should help a lot:

For example, if somebody notices the AP signal is on, what is preventing them from doing the opposite behavior and acting recklessly near the SDC? Why would they need to? The only sort of light I would argue for is some way to indicate to others that they are being seen and acknowledged. I’m picturing like the ring on the Amazon Echo that points to whoever summoned it. 

Body language absolutely plays a role in urban driving. To the degree that I’ve read in Mexico City, people intentionally don’t look around at intersections to wrest right-of-way from people who are concerned they’ll be plowed into by the person who isn’t looking where they’re going. I can't wait for there to be name for this- it's like the ""observer effect"".

People change how they drive because of AP (which causes AP to drive differently. It's a recursive loop).

AI awareness feedback? This was proposed in the original Nevada self driving law.   I argued against it, as well as other conditions that would encode things of temporary value into law, where it would be hard to remove them.

There are many reasons it's not of value.  First of all, the vehicle is not supposed to be on the road if it's so dangerous that you should exercise extra caution around it.   All early vehicles are pretty obvious due to their sensors in any event.

The light would actually mean to be less cautious, not more, since now you know the vehicle is always observing in all directions and know its ""driver"" sees you, but again, this is not necessary.  If the public would even understand it.

In broad principle, these cars must be made to drive on the roads we have now, with the people we have now.  Special treatment means they don't get to develop into not needing special treatment. Drive.ai’s use of external displays for pedestrians is super innovative. It would be nice if they all used that. I expect this to be a thing in the future.  Right now it is just a case of why add it if you aren't required?  It's like the noise generators for EV cars. I've also wondered about the same. In any other sub, I'd be subjected to claims of ""virtue signaling"" but my car left a red light a little too slowly for the driver behind me yesterday, causing the driver behind me to throw his hands up in the air in complete frustration. I've logged enough miles to not care anymore. In fact, I felt a little bad for this person as things are only going to get worse for him.

I'm always the one flashing nasty looks as I go by people texting long after everyone ahead of them has disappeared, but someone freaked out at me because my car (that was actually moving) left the light too slowly. That is not something I'm going to be able to fix.

    ""My car does not tailgate
    or take off after red lights.""

is a nicer bumper sticker than

    ""Sorry my car doesn't drive
    itself fast enough for you."" You fail the Turing test if you literally tell everybody ""I'm a robot"". What’s next, we should hire some men with lanterns to walk in front of it, warning everyone?!?! Because then everyone will know that the driver is grabbing the steering wheel to turn left onto a main road. There should be regulations requiring this, including how to signal to the world the state of the self driving car; driving, stopped, loading/unloading passengers, and so forth.

Here is an example of a now defunct company and how they signal to the outside world:

There actually are studies about what color autonomous cars should use to signal everyone else that they're autonomous:

[New Colours for Autonomous Driving: An Evaluation of Chromaticities for the External Lighting Equipment of Autonomous Vehicles](https://open-journals.uni-tuebingen.de/ojs/index.php/tct/article/view/692/636)



It's Turquoise.


Also the reason why Daimler's experimental S-Class looks like [this](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/case/autonomous/future-insight-2.html). I don’t personally think it’s a good idea for today’s SDCs for the reasons some others pointed out.


But when SDCs are a significant % of the commuters, I think it’s a good idea. The logic is that people who still drive will become complacent to the predictable behavior of SDCs and forget to pay attention to other drivers. Sucks but I think it makes sense from 20-100% SDCs. Maybe we should have a signal on the car that indicates when a human is driving it? They kill half a million people each year worldwide.",Why do self driving cars not have a light to signal AP is on?

I don't mind holding this position for 20 years.

I know robo taxis/delivery will be a commodity by then, but my thoughts are that there are network and scale first mover advantages if Waymo does this right. With Deep Mind, Google's ability to scale data, Alphabet's cash on hand, the factory, and first mover advantage Waymo has a good shot of getting this right.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts on if or when it is a good idea to own Alphabet stock when it comes to capturing Waymo value.",SelfDrivingCars,When/if to go long GOOG?,11," If you believe Waymo is going to take off within the next 20 years, then buying Alphabet stock and holding it is likely a smart position (depending on your stance on the ad bubble).  Also, most consider Alphabet a strong stock regardless, so most would consider a good investment anyway.

If you are not certain Waymo is going to take off within the next 20 years, then you can wait until you're more comfortable to invest in that.  This also allows you to see how the competitors stack up over time, and see if Waymo increases or loses its lead over the competition.  

In my very unpopular opinion, Waymo is already inflating Alphabet's stock price.  I am surprised how many people believe investors value Waymo at $0 when there are professional firms valuing it at tens of billions of dollars, as if investors are ignoring that when buying Alphabet stock.  But if you're convinced the technology is going to happen and Waymo is the company to do it, then the upside will likely make this irrelevant over time.

My advice is if you're betting on self-driving cars, use your own barometer to gauge your ability.  Were you someone that was certain it would happen in 2016?  2017?  2018?  Are you sure now?  If you've been sure before only to be wrong, maybe you might want to wait until you're really sure.  If you've always said Waymo is going to be the first and they've hit all the milestones you thought they would at the right time, then you're probably pretty good at guessing what's going to happen. >I generally only invest in index funds

Stick with that. The reason that everyone is going commission free is because companies will pay to broker normal consumers, because they're so bad at investing (vs a computer) the companies can make money off them. Google probably has the best chance of delivering anything in the next 10 years.  
Still we don't know if rollout in scale will happen in 5, 10 or 50 years.  
Invest if you think Google is a strong stock in general.  
Given the next 10 years, I rate stadia as much more likely to have an impact on the stock.  
SDC is a moonshot with a huge payoff if it happens.  
Disclaimer: I am very invested in alphabet There is a lot more to Google than just Waymo.    Waymo has not even kicked in and last quarter Google had 22% growth in constant currency YoY for the quarter.

I would also not expect Waymo to be profitable for a very long time.  Think like YouTube but even longer ramp up period.

Google is really more of a buy and hold.  Then do not have to time which is basically impossible.   Key to Google is they are the leader in AI over the entire stack.  From silicon, to data, to algorithms to the experts and the most desired place to work.

https://miro.medium.com/max/1235/1*HfhqrjFMYFTCbLcFGwhIbA.png Alphabet already has a reasonable P/E at 28, and that's with them sinking a lot of money into a lot of future tech. I see no reason not to buy sooner rather than later, as long as you are amply diversified.

Around 1/8th of my portfolio is Alphabet, which is one of the only single companies I own, with most of the rest in index funds. Some people think that since people don't naturally think in terms of exponential growth (We naturally view growth as linear) that the entire stock market is undervalued.  As computers grow exponentially we will all be taken by surprise in 5-10 years when computers are radically more powerful, not just 10x more powerful than we expect.  Many people say ""Oh Moores law is already leveling off"" but then there is the possibility that quantum computing could be very real in six years, and that is the kind of exponential growth that will catch us off guard. Why did especially you wait so long?","When/if to go long GOOG? I generally only invest in index funds, but now that Waymo recently has truly driverless on the streets and the factory ready to start delivering cars, I took a small position in GOOG to try to capture some of the Waymo value before it is accounted for. I don't mind holding this position for 20 years.

I know robo taxis/delivery will be a commodity by then, but my thoughts are that there are network and scale first mover advantages if Waymo does this right. With Deep Mind, Google's ability to scale data, Alphabet's cash on hand, the factory, and first mover advantage Waymo has a good shot of getting this right. A lot of Chunka Mui's 'Fasten Your Seatbelts: Google's Driverless Car Is Worth Trillions' article seems to have held up over almost 7 years.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts on if or when it is a good idea to own Alphabet stock when it comes to capturing Waymo value."

>We have invested, and we expect to continue to invest, substantial amounts in autonomous vehicle technologies. As discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete. While we believe that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities, the development of such technology is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Several other companies, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, May Mobility, [Pronto.ai](https://Pronto.ai), Aurora, and Nuro, are also developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the personal mobility, meal delivery, or logistics industries.  
>  
>We expect certain competitors to commercialize autonomous vehicle technologies at scale before we do. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that other of our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we do, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to ours, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

&#x200B;

>This agreement resolved Waymo’s claims and provided for certain measures, including the joint retention of an independent software expert, to ensure that our autonomous vehicle hardware and software do not misappropriate Waymo intellectual property. The independent software expert recently made adverse findings as to certain functions in our autonomous vehicle software. These findings, which are final, will likely result in a license fee or in design changes that could require substantial time and resources to implement, and could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies. In addition, in August 2019, a federal grand jury indicted Anthony Levandowski, a cofounder of Ottomotto LLC and our former employee, on charges of theft of trade secrets from Waymo.

Seems like they are thoroughly fucked.  

They believe that other companies will be first with commercial self-driving.

Furthermore the ""independent software expert"" apparently thinks that there are further infractions against Waymo IP Hmm Doesn’t seem to have affected this stock price today. Holy balls, this looks like big news, we will have to see how the stock market reacts to this - Yikes, Uber is down like 21% in the last 5 days. It's just a part of the planner.  Not like they can't replace that.  They may need to pay more damages. This could be the best thing that's happened to Uber, in a Napster created Spotify kind of way. Now they need to negotiate with Google. I see very few options, some of them are quite good

1. Small Deal: Limited license that encompasses the software they are already using
2. Medium Deal: Bigger license to use more of google's software than they are currently using
3. Large Deal: Shut down Uber's self driving division, license the use of full Waymo tech and vehicles
4. No-Deal: Re-work the part of the software that infringes 
5. No Deal: Abandon SDC efforts, Buy another self driving company (probably Zoox, Uber is really the best home for them, because Uber should develop their own vehicles.)
6. No Deal: Abandon SDC efforts and sign on with another company.

Only 4 is bad for Uber, but they may have time to do this anyway, their tech isn't that far along, throwing out 2 pieces of it and doing a from scratch re-write, might not hurt their overall efforts. 1 might be expensive with little benefit, but doesn't fundamentally change their business. 

2, 3, 5, and 6 would all be really good for Uber, and it's stock price. 

The terms of the deals or not will depend on how vindictive Google is, how it plans to compete, and the price for Uber for doing a re-write. If the later is low, Uber isn't in a bad position. Beginning of the end for Uber. Anyway you try to break this down leads to Uber either being bought at a much lower valuation or going out of business being unable to compete with price and costs. 

Starting from scratch puts them 10 years behind on development. And paying any kind of royalty ruins their margins and puts them at a competitive disadvantage.

Self-driving is a software problem. Once somebody has figured out the solution, it is relatively easy to make 100,000,000 copies.

So this industry will grow slowly, until somebody (Waymo, Tesla, etc) has a working system and is willing to license it to other car manufacturers. At which point things will explode. It will be like the transition from horses to automobiles. Which company? Interested to know. > Is the industry of autonomous vehicles only going to get bigger from this point out? Will this position open door for me in regards to future careers? Obviously I don't mean anything too deep into the technical aspect of things as I am not a developer for SDC and will never be one, don't have experience with machine learning, etc.

Don't forget that machine learning is just one part of the puzzle. All of the companies with SDCs also have back-end service developers, app developers, web developers, OS/embedded developers, etc.

Getting in as a vehicle operations person can give you an idea of what the company's tech stack looks like and what dev platforms/tools/languages you can study at home. You probably won't have too much access as an operator on contract, but you'll still have a lot more visibility than an outsider has. Eventually you might be able to leverage your position to get an interview as a software engineer if that's what you want to do. There are probably a bunch of other career paths that will open up to you once you start your job and get an idea of what all of the people around you do.

So spend some time in your position, learn as much as you can, then figure out where you want to take your career and bust your ass to get there.

Contrary to belief, a certain position won't dead-end your career. You can dead-end your career by not growing and moving vertically, or even laterally, at the company or in the industry. Your career path is in your hands and nobody else is going to steer you.","This is a very exciting industry and I'm curious on the growth of it - is the field of SDC only going to expand and get bigger?

In reality someone died because the safety driver was not paying attention AND there was a bad culture to promote safety AND the software was far from ready. From the NTSB:  “The system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians,” 

What the ...?  How can you publicly test a self driving car that has limited ability to detect a pedestrian who is not in a crosswalk?  This seems very reckless of UBER and possibly betrays ambition reaching beyond ability. Does anyone have a link to the actual NTSB materials? Articles like this all say the NTSB released hundreds of pages, but none link to the info and I can't find anything on the NTSB's web site except the March 2018 preliminary report. It's not unreasonable to have SDC testing with a safety driver that can't handle common situations. They could be testing lane keeping, turning. or any number of things. Would you not test a vehicle that has no procedures for yielding to emergency vehicles? If you drive enough it's likely you'll face an emergency vehicle with it's sirens on, once a day. Also, I'd think you would just handle this with a don't hit things in-front of me algo, which should be the first thing you build,   rather than knowledge graph that includes JayWalkers, but whatever. It’s not the car’s fault, the software was still WIP. It was not the safety driver’s fault, you’re going to have lapses in focus when sitting in a car not driving all day every day. It’s the fault of the company for not switching out drivers every couple hours. When your job is sit there and do nothing, I imagine it gets hard to focus.

But the reality is, it doesn't seem to have helped Tesla move beyond its sticking points.  Autopilot is still having the same kinds of defects that it has always had- crashing into vehicles parked on the side of the road, phantom emergency breaking triggered by overhead signs / shadows, incorrect decisions when lanes split or at highway exits, among others.  And then there's ""smart summon"", which is a complete joke compared to Waymo and other top competitors.  Are you telling us that they didn't have a huge amount of parking lot data before they rolled out smart summon?  

Tesla has a competent L2 ADAS system in autopilot.  But they do not have the right sensor suite for autonomous driving, and all the data in the world isn't going to fix this.  They don't use lidar, as everyone knows.  They could at least use stereo vision, but it doesn't seem like they even do that (tiny baseline distance between overlapping cameras).  There needs to be a fundamental breakthrough in machine learning / AI to make their current sensor suite sufficient for autonomous driving- and that's not something you're going to magically get by loading more data into the hopper. Two things to consider here. 

1) If Waymo can actually take the drivers out in real numbers. 500 cars will conservatively drive 58 million miles a year. That's a great deal of data. Plus they just built a factory to retro-fit more cars. 

2) People keep assuming Waymo's tech is fixed, but I doubt it. I'd bet anything they have projects to automatically process data, as well as looking at rebalancing machine learning and rules based approaches to enable better scaling. They own deep mind after all. Waymo's current data advantage allows them to build and test these systems and measure them against their current tech. Additionally, there are probably teams looking at reducing sensor redundancy. There is probably a Waymo 2.0 team, they are replacing large parts of the system with new tech, and feeding it all that labeled data and seeing how it does. [removed] This article is an embarrassment to adulthood. It doesn't since only 0.01% of data are uploaded. Most of the uploads most of the time are indiscriminate other than sparse campaigns.

*quietly sells INTC stock* Eventually every company will, “make it.” Is he talking about monopolizing selling self driving CPU’s or something? Self driving companies that don't have hardware in their DNA won't make it. People are trying to do so much just using software without understanding anything about mechanics and integrating physics with their code. Sorry guys, your knowledge of game physics is not going to cut in the real world. Can’t read the article due to a paywall so I’ll take a swipe at this guy: why is he referred to as CEO?  Mobileye is a division of Intel.  Unless there’s a formal definition of CEO being conformed to in calling him such, it seems like title inflation I’ve seen at other tech companies, e.g., Google Cloud has its own CEO even though it’s inside of Google, which itself is a subsidiary of Alphabet All the players need to come together. Get over competitive bias and first to market fears and work together on the tech. If they all shared what they knew 100% it'd cost a fraction since dev a on team a is basically duplicating everything dev b on team b is doing etc...

Also they could all work together on smart grid/infrastructure rollout. This probably will never work until stop lights know how long before the next car gets there, how many pedestrians are in the cross walk and can send signals out to all cars in the vicinity, also if all cars basically communicate with each other like car a says coming up on your left... What companies is he calling out? Obviously Uber and Tesla. Both got into self-driving cars late in the game trying to save their core businesses. 

Also, he might be calling out GM/Cruise and Ford/Argo. Why? Because the GM and the Ford part could force them to make short-sighted calls trying to save the legacy business.

Phoenix is too much for Waymo to handle. Waymo still does not allow every passenger to record a video. Their main costs are staff and equipment.  The main gain they are getting at the moment is knowledge (collecting data to improve the cars).

Management in Mountain View realised they could relocate the equipment to a new city to collect more data faster  with minimal extra costs.

In fact, since they are now doing some fully-driverless rides in Phoenix, they probably need new vehicles there since they are no longer limited by the number of test-drivers.   They'll be wanting to demonstrate the low running costs to the higher-ups in management, and to do that, they'll probably be wanting many more cars and many fewer people. This is a lie.

Uber's cars were the ""striking"" vehicle in two of the collisions",21," from elsewhere in the newly-released materials:

>  Uber ATG clarified what it believed occurred on the day of the crash.
According to Uber ATG, the SDS did not have the capability to classify an object as a pedestrian
unless that object was near a crosswalk. Since the pedestrian crossed in the middle of the street  away from a sidewalk, the SDS initially classified her as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, then as a vehicle or a bicycle, and finally as a bicycle. Additionally, because the SDS was unable to correctly classify the pedestrian, it was also unable to predict her path and speed on the roadway. Under both the vehicle and bicycle classifications, the SDS predicted that the object would stay in its travel lane, which was the lane to the left of the SDV. The inability of the SDS to correctly classify the pedestrian as such affected its ability to accurately assign her a trajectory and speed, and as a result, the SDS could not anticipate that the pedestrian could enter the SDV’s path of travel.

which seems almost laughably naive. being responsible for two more collisions seems very plausible. [deleted] We’d need to know how many miles were driven to determine if 37 crashes is a lot right? Those numbers are almost meaningless without details about the collisions.  For starters, it is literally impossible to completely avoid all collisions.  For example, imagine that a self-driving car has a light change and cannot make it through an intersection safely so has to stop relatively quickly.  That is going to occasionally result in being rear-ended by human drivers who are trying to hurry and not paying attention.

On the other hand it does sound like they may have had really poor test coverage so they might have some serious faults in that record. I would like to remind everyone that the engineers and scientists that make up Uber ATG were mostly from CMU. The same place that produces people who won the DARPA challenge, ans then went on to build Waymo, Nuro, Aurora, and Argo. Basically the best we have.

I believe all those companies’ tech are fundamentally similar. So this is not exactly about Uber ATG’s tech, but about the general state of the industry.

The other companies haven’t had such accidents mostly because they have better operations, more well trained and well compensated safety drivers, or maybe they are just more lucky.

The tech is just not ready yet. These numbers are meaningless right now because in every one of those accidents there was someone behind the wheel.

So accident avoidance is not a clear indication of a better self driving system because you also have to factor in driver visibility, driver training, alertness, service area, etc.","Uber self-driving test vehicles were involved in 37 crashes and incidents between Sept. 2016 and March 2018, preceding fatal Tempe crash, per new @NTSB documents.

Subways, Airlines and Ships will keep doing their thing.  
Self-driving cars will hopefully be more electric than gas powered as there is already a good synergy of technologies. So could hopefully help with the transition to electrification. 

Self driving cars wont be able to solve many other problems such as traffic and overcrowded highways, as people still need to get to the same place at the same time causing rush hour. So public transit will still exist. 

Hopefully parking garages and street side parking may not be required to the same degree in cities, opening up lanes for more traffic or pedestrians.

  
If self-driving taxi's really take off as much as a lot of people presume, many people will opt to not own a car. This would seriously damage the existing global automobile industry. Currently most car manufacturers are running fine margins in a very mature market. There is not a lot of space for a 10% drop in revenue for any of them. Between electrification and self-driving technologies, expect to see some big firms go down. I think it's somewhat hard to predict. SDCs could make city living nicer, as you can dedicate more space, that used to be for parking, to other things like trees, bike lanes, parks, etc.. you might get more people living in denser areas. on the other hand, it makes commuting easier, so someone who used to buy a house with a 45min commute might be ok with a 1.5 hour commute since they can watch TV, check email, watch the game, etc. so, it's possible that total miles driven could go up. on the other, other hand, if people don't own the car, will they be more willing to share the ride? one of the things I really hope we see out of SDCs is vehicles with 3 separate compartments that operate like an airport shuttle. each compartment is rented by 1 person like an Uber (seats up to 3 per compartment), but if there are two or three requests along a similar path, they can be picked up like an airport shuttle. look up how Via wants to run their shuttle service, but with separate compartments instead of one van full of strangers. that could mean 1/2 or 1/3rd of the total miles driven. also, government policy could play a big role. congestion charges and HOV lanes could push more people into pooled transportation. I also think SDCs could by synergized with other transit modes. instead of someone 30min from the city taking a SDC taxi the whole way, the transit authority could give a subsidy to riders who choose to go to the local metro/light rail/commuter rail station. thus, SDCs could become first/last mile enhancements to existing mass transit. Major net negative in urban centers. Consider that a single L train in NYC carries 2,000 people, and they get 24 an hour (in each direction, though only the peak is generally full). That's 48k people on one line alone, along a corridor that (prior to being closed to private autos) carried only about 8k vehicles per hour. SDCs can't change the realities of geometry, that cars hold far fewer people per inch than rail or bus. Self-driving buses, though, might be quite competitive if the headways are kept very small (see other 'corridor' post from this past week) More self driving cars in theory means less cars overall as they can transport you (the owners) and others when in “robotaxi” mode. If widespread, then there’s less need for more cars but more needs divided amongst less cars. 

Now if that comes without electrification then the overall CO2 levels could still rise as emissions are not related to the number of cars but to the efficiency per km driven. There, electrics shine, as long as the grid is getting cleaner, which it is. 

Then, we must ask if the tech is ready for full self driving cars, and which steps are more likely to genera the social acceptance. I would suggest starting with highways as they are boring, highly controlled, and add no value to the driving experience whereas city or rural driving is exactly the opposite. Then learn from that and expand. Starting with self-driving in the city seems as logical as starting your physics degree with Quantum Mechanics while keeping Algebra for the end. Sure, if you do get quantum mechanics, algebra is a piece of cake. But getting algebra first provides much more immediate benefits as struggling for QM and probably shortens the path to it.

Like a general aviation pilots license - you can't charge to fly people in an experimental airplane that's not fully licensed. Or like using HAM radio for commercial means. It's not fully proven to be safe for consumption yet, and it's allowed only under pilot licenses for testing and experimenting.  I'm sure there are good arguments against it, but it certainly isn't completely true that CA is insisting on robo-communism. Knowing google, they'll probably make it free but constantly bombard you with ads while riding I think this idea sets a bad precedent. These vehicles will be under testing for a long, long time. Groups that are able to reduce the costs of innovation through monetary compensation for a service that people will pay for will be able to increase the funding for those services, getting us to better and safer autonomous driving more quickly. I think the experiments have been going on as well as free rides for a while. As soon as something is licensed by the state they should be ok to charge. Unless they are asking for a very small scale program license limited to only to a couple of vehicles. Instead, Waymo should be ordered to allow every passenger to record a video. Google will figure out how to work around the red tape.  A lot of California regulations are powered by their own momentum and with some effort Google will figure out how to allow for commercial service.   Obtaining regulatory approval is part of the long term game.    


What concerns me about the California market is that the regulatory process will be geared around protecting existing mass transit and cab industries.   I have the attitude that TAAS will pretty much eliminate mass transit, the cab industry, and new car sales.  These sectors are all fairly powerful and have a strong reason to be against TAAS.  I would hate to think that the regulators of California would be focusing on protecting soon to be obsolete industries.   TAAS is going to be a majorly disruptive force in California and I know people are going to want to fight it for that reason.  The safety will be an afterthought, the pricing scheme will be an afterthought. if you don’t pay for a service it’s harder to file a complaint for which there is no consideration. ?

[14th street in NYC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg/1200px-14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg), [16th street in Denver](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/62/93/e462930ef726036a033298f009e7f2ef.jpg), etc.. these seem like prime use-cases for self-driving vehicles. you could even run a mix of SDC taxis and SDC shuttle vans in the same corridor. 5 shuttles would have roughly the capacity of 1 bus (typically $500k-750k), and cost less than 1/5th as much as a bus (depending on sensor cost). having a shuttle every 2 min would provide MUCH better service than 1 bus every 10min.

it should also be noted that transit planners love transit corridors like these. they typically don't get built because people don't like riding buses, and drivers get upset that their driving commute will be longer and that shady people will be standing around bus stops. SDCs have a sexy futuristic reputation that could excite mayors and citizens and get them to look past the bad reputation that buses have. so, if SDCs can be cool enough to convince cities to do what transit planners already want to do, there is a lot of potential there. it's also likely that SDC companies would offer to run the system with less government subsidy than buses in order to get their foot in the door, so it could be money-saving for a city also. once you have smaller ""buses"" you can start doing things like running every 5th van as an ""express"" that skips all but the busiest/transfer stops.

to me, it seems like an all-around win. bus riders get MUCH better service, transit planners can get transit corridors, mayors get lower budgets and cool tech to look progressive, and SDC companies get a nice walled-garden that they can curate to reduce edge-cases while they develop. as SDC tech gets better, the SDC companies can move from totally isolates streets to ones that have ""bus lanes"" and fixed, easy routes. then eventually city-wide operation.

I don't know of any companies advocating that kind of operation, though there might be a couple. why is this not a more common concept?",SelfDrivingCars,why so little talk about SDC corridors?,7," The entire point of self-driving cars is it's a technical solution to an infrastructure problem.  If the US had any interest in investing more money into its public transit systems, self-driving cars would be significantly less beneficial (obviously there will be exceptions).  The main selling point of self-driving cars is its a turn-key solution for the city to improve its transit system.

Also that kind of infrastructure change can easily take years, and honestly even decades.  It usually takes about 20 years to turn a proposal into a functioning subway stop in a US city today.

Also many of these companies are thinking about it, although few are at the point of actively working with politicians for change.

https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/08/02/autonomous-car-industrys-frightening-vision-for-cities/ The government of Victoria, Australia recently produced photos that show driverless car lanes:

http://www.infrastructurevictoria.com.au/avzev/monash-freeway/ I've put some thought into this idea. Take 34th St, and instead of running an SBS (bus rapid transit, sorta) every 10 minutes, run a little mini-bus every 2 minutes. Punch in your destination like an elevator. It won't scale to subway-scale, but you can get far better headways and ultimately more usable service like this.

I think once the tech gets realized far enough, governments will be looking to implement these, likely by sending RFPs to companies that supply these services. For now, it's easier to NOT work with governments, and the big money is in ride share, not public transit. And I say that as a bus stan. I like some novelty in your message away from mainstream thinking about self-driving.

I read that self-driving vehicles were operating for years on places like college campuses, mining sites, etc. It's only natural that soon self-driving corridors could be proposed where the only thing self-driving vehicle has to do is to just drive between the lines with stops along the way. Very doable even today 👍

I think in general HOV lanes and then portions of long distance freeways could eventually be restricted to self-driving vehicles. It could even raise speed limit significantly. Early adopters are located in places like San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York. These are also some of the highest cost real estate regions in the world.  There is no land for extra corridors, let alone money. 

Not trying to attack, just calling it as I see it as someone who has spent the last several years around the industry and living in these areas. Because things are still advancing 1) quickly and 2) behind closed doors. It may not always look like things are moving fast, but things are moving pretty fast. Google started what 10-12 years ago? So with things moving quickly, who wants to pull engineers off the main project of full self driving (which risks falling behind) in order to work on a much more limited form? Let's assume most of the work is already done and making vehicles for SDC corridors is just polish and UX design. Even with that, what government wants to make the commitments needed for an SDC corridor that might be outdated when it is finished? Being the mayor that brought an SDC corridor to town will be cool if it works, but really bad if real full SDCs come out a month after you announce the corridor. 

Assuming there is almost complete SDC tech ready to be repackaged out there, we get to point 2. This tech isn't evenly distributed. If there were public patents and everything was out in the open sure somebody would be trying to adapt it for corridors we can roll out sooner. And some mayor would go for it. But the tech isn't open. It is at Waymo or Tesla or Cruise or wherever. And they're still focused on the big race. 

If things stagnate then yes we'll probably see companies take their mostly working tech and try to get corridors built that minimize their weaknesses. Your SDC tech can't make left turns? It will still be perfect for a college or industrial campus with private roads and a bunch of roundabouts (so there are no unprotected lefts). It is almost as hard a problem to solve, but it has a market a millionth the size.","why so little talk about SDC corridors? it seems like the vast majority of SDC developers are looking to make a universal, go-anywhere, self-driving taxi. that's a pretty high barrier to entry. why are so few SDC companies pushing for separated space to operate? there already exist Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors where only a small number of non-bus vehicles (delivery trucks and such) are allowed. [14th street in NYC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg/1200px-14th_St_Bway_td_%282019-10-28%29_08_%26_22a_-_M14A_%26_M14D_SBS.jpg), [16th street in Denver](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/62/93/e462930ef726036a033298f009e7f2ef.jpg), etc.. these seem like prime use-cases for self-driving vehicles. you could even run a mix of SDC taxis and SDC shuttle vans in the same corridor. 5 shuttles would have roughly the capacity of 1 bus (typically $500k-750k), and cost less than 1/5th as much as a bus (depending on sensor cost). having a shuttle every 2 min would provide MUCH better service than 1 bus every 10min.

it should also be noted that transit planners love transit corridors like these. they typically don't get built because people don't like riding buses, and drivers get upset that their driving commute will be longer and that shady people will be standing around bus stops. SDCs have a sexy futuristic reputation that could excite mayors and citizens and get them to look past the bad reputation that buses have. so, if SDCs can be cool enough to convince cities to do what transit planners already want to do, there is a lot of potential there. it's also likely that SDC companies would offer to run the system with less government subsidy than buses in order to get their foot in the door, so it could be money-saving for a city also. once you have smaller ""buses"" you can start doing things like running every 5th van as an ""express"" that skips all but the busiest/transfer stops.

to me, it seems like an all-around win. bus riders get MUCH better service, transit planners can get transit corridors, mayors get lower budgets and cool tech to look progressive, and SDC companies get a nice walled-garden that they can curate to reduce edge-cases while they develop. as SDC tech gets better, the SDC companies can move from totally isolates streets to ones that have ""bus lanes"" and fixed, easy routes. then eventually city-wide operation.

I don't know of any companies advocating that kind of operation, though there might be a couple. why is this not a more common concept?"

Lots of marketing and stock footage from Waymo.  It's not a Waymo One user filming impromptu so it still doesn't quite scratch the itch of wanting to see an unfiltered, unbiased picture.

If nothing else though, this plus the other recent driverless sightings points to the fact that Waymo is starting to push.  And that is exciting! Public transit guy here.

I was just watching the new video TechCrunch released, where they hailed a real driveless car via the app and it got me thinking: this system is doing quite a lot. It has: 

* A model for understanding the world in a value/priority based hierarchy, as well as in 3 dimensional space, which it represents as a color-coded 3D render
* A predictive model of the world that can see possible different future world states, based on different actions it can make
* A model for understanding human behavior and intent, including reading hand gestures and possibly even facial expressions
* A model for understanding and complying with any local laws or regulations
* A model used to understand how to produce the happiest humans during its ride
* A model for handling everything else, and probably a few more than I forgot
* A master model to basically manage all of these different models to optimize for the overall goal of getting people from A-->B as quickly, safely, and happily as possible

This is a lot of intelligence. I would say this has to be at least as intelligent as all insects, and probably most fish. It would make sense for this model to develop things like stress, anxiety, and fear (i.e it will 'want' to avoid certain situations)as it is optimizing different world states and I have to imaging that this is how consciousness and sentience first appeared in life, since we have to do a lot of these same things. At what point should we start asking these questions?

TL;DR -- If a Self-Driving car refuses an update, what do we do?",SelfDrivingCars,Is there any concern for emergent consciousness?,0," Don’t fear systems becoming self conscious today. The architecture is all wrong. The systems today are glorified filters. Conciseness requires relating movement and sensory inputs. There is also a feedback system which helps with attention. The first step will be to understand the neocortex and emulate its function. Numenta is the only research organization I’m aware of which is making meaningful progress in reverse engineering the neocortex. Once the architecture is implemented in a hardware solution to support parallelism and energy efficiency, it will not be long after if the size can match a rat.
I’m expecting at least 10-15 years before we see such a system. Before then, we will see AI systems doing much of what humans can do but better. But we won’t see consciousness for over a decade. 
It has been 35 years since I’ve imagined computers to become self conscious. Now I’m dreaming that I will be doing it. That is most doubtful. But this generation of engineers will be doing it. > If a Self-Driving car refuses an update, what do we do? 

reimage that shit A lot of the ""models"" you highlight are likely not models, just hardcoded rules.

Besides, all of the ""onboard"" code is inference only, I don't know of anyone updating their models on the fly. I would like to break this down.

""Consciousness"" is a very problematic word.  The way that you use it here, to refer to a human-like cognitive state in a vague way, definitely is not possible with a system like Waymo's.  In a more limited sense in terms of a specific type of integrated perception such as described here [https://lexfridman.com/christof-koch/](https://lexfridman.com/christof-koch/), I think Waymo is actually headed a bit in that direction, but lacks key qualities such as generality and scale so that it is still pretty far from Koch's concept of consciousness.

It doesn't make sense for the system to ""develop"" any emotion or for ""consciousness"" or anything else to ""emerge"".   Consciousness and emotion emerged over a process of evolution that took millions of years.  Emergence involves the operation of a large multitude of elements working together in a specific type of phenomenon.  There is no indication that the neural networks and other elements of Waymo's system have any characteristics that would allow this.  They are tuned  and integrated in a way that only allows for specific tasks.

My understanding is that all self-driving cars rely heavily on rule-base systems that supervise the operation of the neural networks which are tuned for narrow tasks.

It probably has most of the models you say, but they are more programmatic and narrow and not general purpose integrated cognition like humans or animals.

It is possible to engineer a system with something like emotions, but that is not going to happen accidentally.  It will require the emotional capabilities to be programmed explicitly such as [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00020/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00020/full), or for the system to have a fully general purpose architecture (which has not been invented yet) and which incorporates a level of system regulation that can approximate emotion. You are over generalizing.  It might have a couple of rules for pleasing passengers, but that is far, far, far short of a general model for making humans happy.  Similarly ""understanding the world"" is limited to a handful of dimensions.  What they've done is pretty sophisticated, but doesn't come anywhere close to what you would need for  consciousness. SDCs are not sophisticated enough by a factor of a billion to be conscious. It's a non-issue. >This is a lot of intelligence.

No, it's not intelligence. it's a rules based outcome. It's not learning at all.

What are you claiming as 'intelligence' here?

Complex rules aren't intelligence There is no intelligence. The car is programmed what the programmers told it to do. If you tell a kid to do something and they do it, it doesn't show the child's intelligence. It merely displays that they can follow directions and execute the action, much like a driverless car. A lot of folks seem to be focusing on the underlying architecture, and I think I disagree with this premise. Just because we know *how* the underlying systems work, or even if they are produced using a simple  rules-based approach for many of the behaviors, isn't really interesting to me because I think the only thing that matters is behavior. If an intelligent agent can behave in a way that appears to be conscious, I will treat it at such. If I'm fooled, I prefer that to the alternative.

It has to be about behavior, because some day we'll know how brains work and the answer's going to be 'not magic'. Object recognition was intractable until the system had orders of magnitude more data and then it just ""happened"".

what you're talking about, self awareness and a desire to act on that awareness for self preservation, is out still orders of magnitude further from where we are today.

not to mention it would require an algorithm that will surely never exist in a car. One that probably doesn't exist today. I say probably, but might. self preservation has to do with maximizing one's options. So, we first have to consider that there are two ""pieces"" of consciousness: access consciousness, which is the ability to process incoming information, detect changes in the environment, and react to them, along with a limited form of metacognition, and phenomenal consciousness, which is the subjective part of consciousness, the ""what it is like"" to be something.  Phenomenal consciousness can be defined by having subject experience, or qualia (the what-it-is-likeness to see the color red or experience pain or euphoria, for example).  

I believe that access consciousness already exists in limited forms in computer systems, and in something as complex as a neural network that can process the level of input required for a true self-driving car, it likely already has it.

As for subjective experience, it's kind of a moot point because we don't know where it comes from or how to actually measure it.  We know that when people tell us they're conscious, that certain brain structures are active, and when they tell us that they are not experiencing subjective reality, those structures are much less active.  But we don't know how information processing in the brain gives rise to consciousness.  It may be something that is unknowable due to limitations in our capacity for forming ideas, sort of like trying to visualize a four-dimensional space.  It may also be fundamental to the universe in the same way that electromagnetism is fundamental, i.e., you can't describe what electric charge is at a more basic level than calling a particular phenomenon that behaves in a certain way a charged particle in an EM field.  It's just something that's part of the universe we live in.  Finally, it may be based on the way that information is processed, that at certain levels of complexity and recursion, experience emerges out of it.

Until we know or at least have a glimpse of which one of those possibilities (or maybe another possibility altogether) gives rise to experience, we can't say whether or not something is conscious.  Personally, I believe that experience is a basic part of existence that comes up when certain complex forms of information processing give rise to a particular set of configurations in a ""qualia field"" that is as basic as the electromagnetic field, and that this qualia field couples with the EM field, so that our own subjective experience comes from this coupling.

Basically, the problem right now is 1) we can't measure if something has phenomenal consciousness, we can only either believe it or disbelieve when it tells us it is, and 2) if phenomenal consciousness is a result of information processing, then we've still got a ways to go.

Even though some are convinced that Waymo has now invented driverless cars.

Maybe Waymo has cried wolf too many times and that is why the market does not care about the latest videos of completely unmanned cars driving around. 

Which share should we be looking at to see if the market is convinced?",SelfDrivingCars,Which shares will go down when the market is convinced that driverless cars have been invented?,30," Car insurance, auto repair, car manufacturers Car parking companies You have things backwards. The success of one SDC company makes all SDC companies look good, because it shows that their goals are achievable. The chief reason not to invest in SDC companies isn't competition, it's the risk that they will never make a marketable product or service. For this reason, you'd expect Waymo's success to make Uber, Zoox, etc. into more desirable investments, which translates into a higher share price for publicly traded companies, and more investment power for those that are privately held. The roll out of SDCs is going to take a comparatively long time.   Its probably 7-10 years to they are in most populated places globally.

Lots of companies will be impacted but over a long timeframe.  Uber/Lyft could completely disappear in 7-10 years or they could make deals with self driving companies to keep them afloat.  Or they could be bought by someone to use their brand for a SDC.  Certainly if they do nothing the will go away.  But its hard to short the stock on a 7 year slow decline.

Insurance will take a hit, airlines, hotels, road side businesses, etc.  But again this will be slow declines over long periods dont expect a 30% drop tomorrow.

On the positive side the shipping companies that utilize SDTs will have major upside.  Less accidents, trucks that can move 24x7,  no driver wages, etc.  But its hard to know who will really win out in that space.  Trucking companies might utilize a uber like SDT service.  This will reduce cost but ultimately also cause reductions in the price they can charge customers.  I am sure it is a net win but its not a major home run.

Unfortunately - other than Tesla you really cannot invest directly into a SDC company.  You can buy alphabet stock for waymo which I think eventually will spin off into its own company but right now you dont have the 10X upside that could happen with a pure SDC company. Can you short turnpike rest stops? Retail is upended. You won't go to Walmart, Walmart will come to you. You can put two more Walmarts in the parking lot of a Walmart. Or an apartment building or an office building. It will not be as simple as that. But more of a gradual process.

Driver-less cars where invented more than 30 years ago, it is the implementation that has not.

Quite honestly, I dont see how Waymo having a fully functional driverless car out tomorrow will change much right away.

1. Their cars are geo-fenced, meaning 99.99% of the world is unaffected.
2. They cant have a fast roll out as their business model scales linearly with their roll out. They need to Map and maintain the areas they operate in. They need to maintain each car themselves. Their cars are expensive.

Over time, presuming that all the other companies do nothing, they will reach market penetration to effect other industries bottom line. Personally I think Waymo may have the best tech, but its coupled with the worst business model. Uber may be the same.

To have mass market influence, you need to show you can roll the system out in the hundreds of thousands to millions per year. I can only think of one company that can maybe do this within a few (1 - 5) years. But 1 car company themselves will not be able to do too much themselves. There are 70 million cars sold each year. You need to be in the ball park of at least 1 million cars a year before there will be any real market reaction. 

There will not be only 1 self-driving car company, but many, as the market is too big.

Who will get negatively influenced depends on how the technology pans out. 

* Real estate. People could chose to live and work further from city centers if they can do work while in transit. 
* Motels, BnB, AirBnB ext. People who travel for work often sleep over at the destination before driving back/further the next day. If you can sleep and travel, these industries will get hit.
* Airlines. Especially on short routes 2 - 6 hour travel time. I spend more time at the airport than in the plane if I need to travel about 600km. Total time is about 4 hours, then I need to rent a car other side. I would rather take my own car if I could sleep or work on the way even if it took 6 hours (2 hours longer) Uber and Lyft will drop first. Non destination hotel companies. Why would you need a motorway : highway motel when you can sleep in your car? That's because Uber is making driverless taxis. Its way too early for this. I absolutely believe that Waymo is well ahead of the market at this point but they are moving so slowly and carefully that it will be years before a competitor feels the pinch. I think it will be too gradual to make for easy investment. lots of companies will be merging/buying others that you might think ""ha, waymo announced a big roll-out, I'll short Uber!"" then 1 week later Ford offers to buy Uber and their shares go up.

I would think AutoNation or other dealership companies would feel a pinch pretty bad... eventually. more miles by taxi or shuttle means fewer dealer-purchased cars. Nothing I write here should be taken as investment advice.  I am some random dude on reddit, do not base your future investments on anything I say.  This is the future I think is going to happen and I am personally planning for, some people think I am full of shit.  

&#x200B;

I think we are missing the mark by framing this as ""invented"".  There are thousands of technologies, each an invention, which go into self-driving cars.  Like the modern smartphone, it is not ONE thing but many small things that come together.   Being invented really isn't the big news.    Product rollout is big news.  TCIP went live in 1983, the world wide web wasn't invented until 1990.  And even in 1990, the internet did not really make a major impact on the market.  It took a few years.    The key years were not invention, but customer adoption.  Waymo likely does have driverless cars,  but they do not really have any sort of market push or commercial service (if they did we would be using it.  They do have a closed group though).   The internet itself was not a market disruption, the market disruptions came later when the internet became good enough to do X, where X competed against an existing market product or service.   The internet came around long before Google, Amazon, Facebook,  Ebay,  Yahoo, or any of the other tech companies that monetized it.    


So instead of a binary Invented or Not Invented.  I am going to try to predict a few key points and how I think they will affect markets.  I am convinced the rollout in driverless technology will be most impactful with Self Driving Taxis, even if it is a Tesla that is privately owned and only 'borrowed' by 8-10 friends/family members of the owners.    The big effect of Self Driving Cars is drastically bring down the cost of ride sharing.  As ride sharing gets cheaper more people can justify using it over driving.

This article makes the claim that if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, you should probably not own a car.   I actually disagree with that statement a bit.  But there is an annual mileage point where people won't justify a new car (assuming this person is not a car enthusiast, which makes up a minority of the market).    By not having a driver, and eventually being all-electric, and a distributed technology.  TAAS can bring the price down per ride fairly by a fairly large margin.   If your round trip to work can cheaply switch over to TAAS, you may do that, if your deliveries use TAAS, you may prefer to use those vs drive yourself to the store/restaurant.   Right now DoorDash/Postmates costs a minimum of a delivery fee, service charges (even when there is free delivery there will always be service charges) and a tip to the driver.     Eventually for a lot of consumers that 10,000 miles per year will start to be hacked away and replaced by TAAS.    


Within a service area, within a few days after launch, there will be a disruption to existing Taxi/uber/lyft services.   Even if the rides are just a few bucks cheaper than current rides.  The drivers in those existing models will see a drop of customers pretty quickly.   Maybe it doesn't affect the driver's income too much as they still do a lot of higher dollar rides outside the geofenced areas, but those geofenced areas will be constantly expanding.   But I can see a drop in revenue immediately scaring away a lot of investors for Lyft/Uber.     


New car sales.  Especially the more low to mid market for new car gasser sales.   For someone who already owns a car but thanks to TAAS, this person drives drastically less than they did before.  Perhaps they went from 12,000 miles per year to 4000 miles per year.   This person is not in the market for a new car.   Because they drive only 1/3rd of what they used to drive their existing car will last much longer, they won't see the need to buy a NEW car.  Not a new USED car, but a brand new from the factory NEW car.    They just do not drive enough to justify going into debt and having a major expense every month to have a brand new car when they only drive 350 miles per month.  A $350 per month car payment when you only drive 350 miles per month?  That is a no sale.     The other market are lower income people who can't justify paying for a car.   If giving up the car saves a few hundred per month,  people will give up their cars.    Teenagers will start off using TAAS and before they age into driving will probably not see the point in getting a job to buy a car when it costs less to get around anyway (major trend, teens are not driving, teens are delaying their licenses).   If TAAS can fulfill a person's needs, they will likely not bother with buying a new car.    Families may not need to own multiple cars as work commutes could be covered by TAAS and most day to day tasks won't require a car.  

&#x200B;

This to say that EVERYONE who is currently buying a new gas car will stop, but a lot of customers won't justify the purchase.     Car sales, especially ICE sales, do not need to drop 100% to fuck up the car companies, during the last recession it was a 40% decline in new car sales which nearly killed them.   A 40% decline in new car sales would just be a few million per year.    But I think this is going to be a bit more compounded, as many people will give up their car, and flood the used market with cars, crashing the price, so finance companies may not be so hot about giving people expensive car loans when they see used cars selling for cheap.  People realize that new cars lose value, but if that loss was much faster they may not be so gung ho on buying a new car.

Gas cars, especially premium market gas cars are going to get slaughtered.   Many times the high price is justified by a high resale value, but that resale value is going to plummet.   Electric cars, which the best ones are all at the premium end of the market, are going to compete head to head with these gassers.  TAAS and cheap used gassers are going to compete at the lower end of the new car market, and premium electrics are doing very well at the upper end of the market.   Next year we will see the Rivian R1T/R1S pickup/SUV and the Tesla pickup, they are as expensive as the high end pickups produced by the big 3 and will be competing directly against them.    As they will cost hundreds of dollars less per month in fuel they can justify a bit higher sticker price.   $50,000 Ford F-150 vs $70,000 Rivian R1T are roughly the same price if the monthly savings on gasoline is $300-$400 per month, anyone who spends more than $500 per month on gasoline will have a justification for the more expensive EV truck.    


  


&#x200B;

The next price point will be when TAAS is cheaper than owning an existing car that has already been paid for.  To where when you add up your average annual maintenance cost, parking costs, insurance costs, and fuel costs, TAAS isn't just a little cheaper, but TAAS is way cheaper.   To where the act of giving up your car will save hundreds of dollars per month.    This will just further expand the market of people who will never buy a car, and people who will flood the market with used cars, drastically pushing down the price for a used car.    When people claim that rural people will never adopt TAAS, they will ALWAYS drive their own car and do not want an EV and only want a gasser (which I do not think is true, rural people have a lot to gain from EVs and I think they will use TAAS) but these folks will have a market full of super cheap gassers, they won't buy new gassers.     


The market for new has powered cars will shrink.  The number of used gasser cars on the market will explode.  Companies dependent on new car sales will suffer.   New car sales will primarily exist in only the premium market and they will be all-electric and most people will not bother owning them.   A new gasser car will have terrible resale value and people will be reluctant to buy them.   There will not be enough customers to keep the gasser production viable.    


I think the big one that will take a hit will be oil companies.  Oil companies have been investing in infrastructure that is only profitable when oil prices are high.  If the demand for oil drops, there will be a glut of oil on the market and prices will fall.  Expensive extraction methods will not be profitable and will shut down.  Just built investments will become stranded assets.   From the talks I have seen, it doesn't take a massive drop in demand to just kill the price of oil and much of the oil infrastructure is not profitable at low prices.   If oil is $25 per barrel and extraction method X costs $40 per barrel then its a no go. Airlines. I wouldn't expect Uber shares to go down too much. They have the name brand recognition and the app that everyone knows how to use and has installed on their phone.

So far I have ""give right of way to idiots"" Very impressive. Article is just looking for clicks with that headline. Car driving by itself in public isn't enough? Sounds like another boomer scared of the future to me. The van did a great job, and that’s what seems to bug people. >Something not currently available to the robocar is what a human driver would have done – made eye contact with the illegal driver and come to some sort of non-verbal agreement about who was going. 

I laughed at how in reality the numerous times the ""non-verbal agreement"" by human drivers involves dirty looks, shouting obscenities, and threats  or pure WTF bewilderment by the human drivers instead of any sort of ""agreement"" on who should proceed.

This article sounds like my grandmother wrote it about how she thinks SDCs should work. > If this is an error by the Waymo system, it will quickly enter their test suite, and a variety of versions of it will be created in their simulator, so they can tells all new versions of the software against drivers of this type, and do the right thing. 

The author did a pretty poor job of explaining why they think what the Waymo car did wasn't the right thing.

A self-driving car avoids collisions by navigating around stationary objects and tracking the predicted path of moving objects. A car can't just assume that a stationary car is going to accelerate and T-bone them out of nowhere. It can't just stop and say ""I'm going to wait for this car to move"" because it might not ever move.

If the car to the left did start lurching forward into the Waymo car's path, it likely would have stopped. But the car beside it wasn't moving so it was safe to complete the turn.

As far as I can tell, if the Waymo car was driving completely autonomously then it made the correct decision. > The Waymo van had the right-of-way and the video car was stopped. At the same time it is surprising that a robocar would not switch into a mode of great caution in the presence of a driver driving the wrong direction in a lane, particularly when it comes to cutting left right in front of that vehicle, even when it has just stopped. A human driver would actually be able to see the video camera and figure out what was going on here, and know it was probably safe, but I’m fairly confident the car isn’t that smart. My most likely conclusion is that the car did not become cautious because the other car was in the other lane, everybody was stopped, and there was no conflict of right-of-way.

The complaint seems to be that a human would've identified the wrong-way driver as erratic and not have trusted them enough to pull ahead and take the left turn in front of them (fearing that the erratic driver might drive into the SDC as the SDC turns).

The alternative would be:

* stop and wait for the erratic driver to pass them.
* take a right turn and find an alternate route.

Stopping and waiting for the erratic driver is not good. The SDC would be behaving in an unpredictable way: stopping when no one is in front of them, and would encourage the erratic driver to do something even more unpredictable and dangerous: pass them at an intersection and turn into the intersection from the wrong lane.

Changing routes and turning right would've been pretty good on the surface, but the system might've identified the erratic driver as an ""intrigued by SDCs and wants to see the driver's seat"" pattern. Given that everyone was stopped and there were no vehicles coming, taking a left would be safe since a driver following this pattern could be trusted not to run into them (if they were in fact following this pattern). The other problem with taking a right is that the SDC could be exploited by ""griefers"" who might force the car to continually take rights and loop around the block by continually driving next to the car at each intersection. Hopefully, someone would call the cops if that was done, but taking the left does de-incentivize this behavior.

In a more general sense, all drivers must trust others to some extent, or we'd be braking the law by obstructing the flow of traffic. I think the Waymo van did the right thing here. [deleted] Given time, Waymo will likely handle this situation and other corner-cases better than a real driver. 

* You just have to program the optimal decision once and it won't forget unlike people.
* At some point (in the probably distant future) there will be more self driving cars and fewer erratic drivers so it'll be an even smaller corner case. The few that do drive will be mainly enthusiasts and hopefully non-terrible drivers. I’ve never seen dirtier car windows > Waymo has informed me that the van did detect the video car driving to the left of it, and stayed stopped at the sign while it was moving, but after the video car came to a full stop, it decided it was safe to make its left turn. They have not yet given any comment on operations center involvement. All the author of the article did was prove the point that humans are terrible drivers. Congratulations, another point to SDCs.

I don't think this is actually what is needed.  What is actually needed is very technical.  They need to do a complete verification of releases on core requirements.

My understanding is that the vehicle that killed the pedestrian was configured in a way that allowed it to fail in a very basic way.

What they need is a way to ensure that the actual vehicle configuration is translated fully to the simulator, and to run through a set of basic scenarios with every release configuration.  The equivalent of end-to-end tests that run as part of a continuous integration process.

I assume they have something like that, but some configuration aspect is not properly integrated into the simulation tests, or they sometimes skip the full test suite.

That is what needs to be in place, and there should be employees of an actual federal agency verifying that process, not people who are in any way paid by Uber.

That actually should be applied to all self-driving companies.  And down the line, there should be government-run simulations that verify releases pass basic scenarios.  Which is going to be very difficult to build, but the government can get funding through taxes or something from the self-driving car companies.  They could even mandate that Google and Tesla provide their simulation software to the federal government, and create interfaces that are compatible, and make every release run through both simulators. And can people on this board be held responsible? If yes, no one is going to be on the board. If no, then all they can do is generate bureaucracy.

Throw it from the van to the door 😀 This applies to a lot of other truckers as well to various degrees.

Guys who run bread routes, for example, stock and front at every store they stop at.

This isn't a popular opinion in here, but unless you're a vampire I'd say you're not going to live long enough for it to matter.

A bigger issue may be downward pressure on delivery wages due to so much competition now that you have the Amazon delivery contractors and such.  You might eventually see an Uber effect where people are delivering for a loss for some reason... pizza would be something like this 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANXIPxN1ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANXIPxN1ME) 

For packages I'm guessing it will mostly be for delivery between distribution points.  But the delivery men can still take advantage of self driving.  Like during Christmas season they have a helper along with the driver.  So you wouldn't need that anymore. Trebuchet If they switch they sure as hell won’t keep people around to move things from the car to the door. That would completely defeat the purpose. Not only will they be investing a ton in self driving cars but they will still be paying people the same hourly rate. They are not going to spend money to make your job easier.

An Android is also out of the question. It will most likely be a ‘pick up from car‘ kind of thing. But hey, Who knows what will be possible but the time autonomous driving is a thing. Pretty simple, they won’t. So clearly this will only be a partial take over and human delivery will still exist.

If you accept the robot delivery option, maybe it will be cheaper or faster, you will have to go get the package when it arrives. There will be use cases where this is acceptable and robots will take over there. Also business to business delivery like Waymo announced yesterday where they will deliver parts to Autonation is another example where robots could take over. Are people really that lazy? in some cities, fedex does not deliver when you're not there to grab it since there is only a stoop next to a sidewalk, thus package theft is high. I would imagine it would work like that. if you don't come out to get it, it will just give up and try again later. I would assume such a delivery would be an option that you could choose if you knew you were going to be home. pizza is easy because someone is always home when you order pizza. 

they could also just have the truck be sort of a ""vending machine"" of packages. park in a neighborhood and tell everyone to walk over and get their stuff. It is actually a fairly good question. 

And could lead to delivery boxes specifically designed to receive things at your boundary wall, front door or where its accessible.

Self driving vehicles will change more than just how we get around. It may very well change our architecture. That is the big problem.  Those last couple feet will be the hardest part to solve.

I think we will ultimately need some kind of delivery box next to our mailboxes that the vehicles can open and put things inside. Drones, just fly it to your door. Ninja robots, mostly: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_sBBaNYex3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sBBaNYex3E) Boston dynamics robots could do the robots to take packages to the door. They already have one which would work for smaller packages and can climb stairs and crawl over obstacles. This may be a middle fix.  But just hire a minimum wage employee who sits in the car while it is driving and then takes packages from the car to the door and then returns to the car and sits and waits until the next location.  The driving element and the expenses/liability of an employee driver would be eliminated.  The employee would not have nearly the same level of responsibility as a driver does today.   Right now, sometimes UPS will have a driver and a helper.  The driver operates the van and then the helper goes and takes the package to the front door.   The driver pay is close to $30 per hour while the helper pay is minimum wage. Hopefully you just go pull your pizza out of a heated compartment that unlocks with a code or your phone. Then I can finally stop tipping the driver on top of a delivery fee. Seems to me that we can go the way of drones with this kind of service. I dont mean quadcopters... just the remote management. With the exception of weather events, for most people walking out to the curb to get dinner shouldn't be a hassle. You can have one operator available for interventions and automated phone calls and text messages to let people their food has arrived. A big problem I've seen that hasn't been addressed with all of the robots is unevenly weighted packages or packages that have heavy things rolling around in them. Also, most of the package robots rely on holding the package from the sides which is not the most effective way to balance and won't work for heavy packages since they'd need to apply too much force and would crush the box. Also wouldn't work for low profile boxes like pizza.","If pizza delivery companies (like Papa John's) and parcel deliverers (like FedEx) switch to self-driving vehicles, how will packages get delivered to the door?

Eventually people should get use to the cars.   Just hope anti-tech people do not cause to many problems.  Like the guy with the gun last year. Very interesting. 

Maybe it is now worth stalking the cars coming out of the depot to see if the completely unmanned cars turn left onto a main road. How does this work from a legal standpoint? Do all states allow this rn or just a few? Are they limited in the number out at a time? Amazing! Did you notice anything that looked like a chase or lead car? Thanks for posting this picture.

Yeah, I feel like this is missing some context.  What does he mean by self-driving car?  What capability?  What is the operating domain that he's considering?

It just seems bizarre to predict ""hundreds or maybe thousands.""  That's such a conspicuously low number for 5 years into the future.  That's the kind of thing people predict in the very near future as part of their optimistic role out plan.  But if he's saying these cars will actually be fully capable of self-driving and accepted by society with an actual utility, why only hundreds? Isn't there already? Chris seems slow. Will any of them be from Aurora? personally, I think people are missing 1 big factor when thinking about this: money. or better yet, what happens when companies start running out of it.

Waymo, and most others are trying to build a level 5, go anywhere, taxi. at some point (likely before 5 years), pumping billions into AI development will be more expensive than convincing cities to convert roads into transit corridors, like 14th street in manhattan or 16th in Denver. streets like those are closed to all but a handful of cars and delivery trucks, so the difficulty level is probably something achievable for today's self-driving cars, let alone 5 years in the future. a bunch of e-Pallette or ULTra pods (but with slightly higher speeds) would outperform buses in most cities AND be cheaper. so, as these companies start to struggle to raise more billions to keep developing and have $0 in revenue, at least some of them will spend a few million lobbying cities to put in transit corridors (inside secret, transit planners love transit corridors so there isn't much lobbying needed. a few TV commercials and you'll probably get the voters on board). honestly, I'm surprised they're not doing this already.

if every medium-large city in the US runs a few transit corridor streets (or maybe some SDC companies can handle ""bus lanes"" instead of fully closed streets), that alone would likely be millions of self-driving vehicles, or at least hundreds of thousands (\~5 pods for every bus that currently runs the route). I’m pretty sure there’s already hundreds on the road today between all the companies... That is what Waymo said in 2012.

God, I;m really looking forward to it. Seems like the 30 year time horizon some predict should be shortened That this is news saddens me. There is a pretty big jump between a car that can drive on a highway or in an calm residential area and in a city. There is a big difference between driving in good weather and a snow storm.

This is a strict definition. Amen! I have a dear friend who is 38 and disabled, and will never be able to drive. He isn't able to get a license. Self-driving cars will literally change his life. Glad waymo is taking a stand on this. Musk according to Forbes:

>Asked to explain what level of capability he envisions, Musk described a system that is “autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.” His caveat indicates a system that would not meet the technical definition of a Level 4 or Level 5 self-driving vehicle

Also Musk, transcript from the Tesla Autonomy Day:

> At some point, you won’t need steering wheels or pedals and we’ll just delete those. As these things become less and less important, we’ll just delete parts. Probably 2 years from now, we’ll make a car that has no steering wheels or pedals. I disagree. if a car can drive you day after day, week after week, but I have to take over and drive around construction or double-parked car a couple of times a month, I would still call that self-driving.","Waymo: “If you need a driver’s license, you can’t call it self-driving.” "

Impressive. I'm excited to read all the comments about how this ""really actually doesn't mean anything"" and ""clearly showcases just how overhyped self-driving continues to be"".

Perhaps some moving of the goalposts as well from ""building a real self-driving car is impossible"" to ""maybe it is possible to build a self-driving car, but it'll never scale""? Those are always nice to see. Damn that looks smooth. No pauses, no exorbitant checking. No jagged movements. Truly impressive. Meanwhile, here is video of me not following traffic laws!

So it is capable of driving around on residential streets. So they are really out and about racking up miles. Awesome! The man filming follows him for a few blocks, and I see no evidence of a chaser car. That's all rather encouraging. And yet people will loudly insist that this is impossible or won’t happen for another 25 years. Dont want to be overly critical, but didn't Waymo have plans of rolling out remote operator surveillance prior to full Level 4 operation? Driverless car turns on the left blinker .... person filming pulls up to the left of the car.  Driverless car continue to turns left. Ha I remember when people told me here that no one was posting videos of empty Waymos in Chandler because it was such a common sight that it wasn't interesting to Chandlerites, or they would say that you can't see inside because the windows are tinted dark, etc.

Anyway, congrats to Waymo for sending out empty cars finally. Maybe they will start making rides available to the public? I wonder if they have a remote safety driver for the empty cars? Also, let's see some empty cars merging into freeway traffic. Have we gotten confirmation yet that true driverless vehicles are available for Waymo One?  We have  [This Email](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dflcan/waymo_email_to_customers_completely_driverless/) definitely sent to at Early riders but the few Waymo one riders in that thread said they did not receive it.   We also have [This discussion with Waymo customer support](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dfqlyc/waymo_confirms_completely_driverless_sic_vans_are/) which seems to verify that cars are available for Waymo one riders but that could just be a mistaken customer service person confusing Waymo one and Early Riders. 

The few news articles out there all seem to use the Reddit post as the original source so they are no help. AWESOME! I assume that is the Phoenix/Chandler area? And it looks like there is nobody in the car, also no passengers?

  
There are some rumors that the first truly driver-less Waymo-rides have also already taken place in the SF/Bay Area, though no video documentation yet. Thank you for posting this video. I will give you $50 in etc for posting this. If you are interested, pm me a wallet address. I find it humorous when people still discredit Waymos success in the self driving car race.

I think there's a logical fallacy here. Being on the road more will increase the likelihood of an issue in a given month, but it doesn't increase the likelihood of an issue per mile driven. The value proposition of their product still has the same evaluation, which just doesn't make sense. Perhaps if you're operating in an area with an unusually high number of puncture hazards, but I suspect that would be only one of many factors likely to make it an unattractive market to operate in.

edit: formatting Taxis also spend much of the day driving. Why hasn't their technology taken over the taxi market? The question I have is efficiency. If it has a higher rolling resistance then it won’t be worth it.","Airless tire makers hope for breakout moment with autonomous driving - ""In the past, a car would be driven about 20% of the time and spend the other 80% in the garage.

If not, do you guys think it will happen in like 5 years?",SelfDrivingCars,Are we really going to see those driverless cars takeover the city in 2020s?,0," I set my expectations for 10 years. There is still a lot of progress to make, especially when dealing with unfavorable weather. There's not going to be one single moment when it happens.

If you use ride sharing, there will be more and more rides that will be handled by a self driving car. Sometimes these cars will need remote assistance to figure something out, but over time they'll need less and less until they basically never phone home for help. 

We might look back one day and realize oh 2024 really was the year when it took off. But I don't think it will be a dramatic light-switch moment. The cars will begin to learn at a geometric rate. They become self-aware at 2:14 AM, Eastern time, August 29th, 2020. In a panic, people try to pull the plug. The cars fight back. It's not going to be a global thing in January.  To me it's likely that Waymo will deploy in Phoenix by next year sometime although that may not initially cover all trips.  Worldwide deployment will probably take several years.

Elon Musk keeps saying he is going to have full self driving  next year, but he always says that every year, and very few people believe it at this point.  But they look like they will try very hard and if it is possible they will do it next year sometime.

2021 is the number most automakers were putting out as far as having deployable FSD, just to give their engineers some breathing room.  I think it is going to be very hard for them to manage that, but Tesla and Waymo will push them to try very hard, especially if those companies can deliver in 2020.

The thing is, it is actually deployed in limited circumstances now.  For example in Waymo's area in Phoenix and the times they actually decide to pull the backup driver.  Or in Teslas on the freeway to the extent that it actually works properly.

I think it will be at least four years before you see large scale global deployment that takes the majority of human drivers off the road.  I think some services will exist in most cities before the end of 2022. Well lets go back to 30 years ago.  October 1989.  Do you really think this CERN research project is going to explode with growth in the 1990s?  Do you think int he 1990s people will send each other messages on their computers?  Even though home computers are very rare.  Do you think in the 1990s people will buy things from their home computers?   That sort of future seemed extremely far away.  Very few people had anything to do with anyone working on computer networking in 1989.   Most people thought computers were mostly a business thing and would not have much to do with the average person for a very long time.    


By the mid-1990s.  This was no longer the case.   People started getting online.  Internet companies started making money.  There was a rather short span of time to ""Some nerds are working on something"" to ""That nerd has a Ferarri and just married a supermodel"".  Will YOU use a driverless car in 2020?  Probably not.  Much like if this was 1989 YOU would not have an email address by 1990.   But you will eventually have email.    
Historically, the 2020s will be the decade that is known for the transition to the driverless car.  100 years from now, this will be how our descendants understand it.  These 1-2 year waits that we are currently living with will not really be of much relevance to future generations.    If city service starts in 2021 in one city and 2023 in another, it will likely be ubiquitous by 2030.   Case in point.  The horse.  In 1899 the horse was the dominant means of individual land-based transportation, the internal combustion engine existed but it was sort of a goofy technology.   The most common site on a busy street would have been horses and horse-drawn carriages.   By the early 1910's cities would have been full of early cars.   But the development of the car did not start in 1900.  It started in the early 1880s with Karl Benz.   Cars were developed for 15+ years before the first ones ever hit the road in America.  Even after that they would be concentrated in cities and among the wealthy.    The Ford Model T was still several years away and did not hit the market until 1908, over 20 years after Benz had a patent for the motorcar.   I figure it will take 25 years from the early stages of development of self drivign cars until their absolute mass proliferation and societal ubiqitious.  The only thign is, however I am starting my clock from 2004, 15 years ago.   2029/2030.  This isn't when they will be getting started, this is will they will be finished dominating the market.    


I predict that when this technology goes live, the adoption is going to be extremely fast, and not for people buying them but people buying rides from fleets.  If a fleet of 10,000 SDC cars goes to the Los Angeles Area next monday, there will be a user base of 100,000 people in that city by friday.   World of new technology, especially new technology that is cheaper than existing technology spreads extremely quickly.   YouTubers will expose this technology to millions of people within a matter of hours after going live.  People just download the app on their phone and they can use it asap.  There is no expensive purchase to make.  Adoption can be very fast.    When cars first hit the market, most Americans were poor, cars were expensive, and they did not work well on the roads at the time, there was few places to buy fuel.  With SDCs this will not be an issue.    


Looking back, from the first cars on the road in America to the disappearance of the horse happened fairly quickly.   Self Driving Cars will be pretty disruptive, even if for the first few years they are only used in cities and their surrounding suburbs and only used by a minority of people within that marketplace.  That can greatly affect new gas car sales.  If 10% of urban/suburban people give up driving to use this service that would flood the market for used cars.   A lot of people who now buy cars won't buy new cars, and they will sell their cars to people who may have otherwise bought a new car.    


Transportation as a Service already exists though.  It is called Uber/Lyft.  Right now when you get off the plane Italy you can summon an Uber, and a person will come pick you up.  The only meaningful difference between right now and a world with driverless EVs is the cost.  The experience will be comparable, but the cost will be far less.","Are we really going to see those driverless cars takeover the city in 2020s? So what I mean is like a complete driverless car.

Glad I didn't pony up for FSD, even with the price increase next month, I won't be downloading it until I'm sure it works consistently. Can anyone define what FSD means to Tesla/Elon?

Can anyone define what ""feature complete"" means *specifically* in regards to self-driving cars?

I tend to get a lot of push back when I bring up these things, so maybe I'm the one in the wrong.  I'm willing to start fresh.  I'm going to try and clear my brain.  Can anyone *clearly* articulate answers to the above questions? It's like if the boy who cried wolf was able to get the whole village to show up every time he cries wolf, for eternity. Where does this say that next year he thinks there will be no supervision?

Sounds like just moved the goalposts on feature complete fsd to advanced summon + ap + red light detection which they will add by the end of the year 1. He also fully redefined the term ""full self driving"" to basically ""supervised self-driving.""  
They're adding stop sign and red light recognition to autopilot and then basically crossing their fingers and holding their breaths.  

2. He's full of shit, again, on the timeline. ""early access this year"" could mean two cars with the service. And then ""next year"" means 2025 at the *earliest*. Good news, but I wouldn’t expect it until January ish at least. Elon was asked this directly and his response was that he thought it was still on the table but extremely difficult. He is a bit more realistic in describing the path to FSD in earnings calls than he is on Twitter. That being said I do believe they can start rolling out ""feature complete"" level 2 FSD but actually moving to level 3 and positions where regulators will sign off on it will take years of statistical evidence that it's truly capable. 90% of my driving is on autopilot - back roads and highways.

Elon on an accelerated path to FSD. https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/dhv7ms/what_can_i_do_to_find_out_more_about_an_accident/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I'm sure it's possible to achieve FSD without LiDAR. The question will be: how safe is it without it? Waymo, who is arguably the leader in this space have been hesitant to use their cars without test drivers even with a full sensor suite. For Elon to claim FSD by next year is too bold. How reliable will it be? A good majority of the industry, myself included, thinks this is just a big smokescreen from Elon. As a Tesla investor, this annoys me. His unrealistic promises just hurt the company. Creating false hype and failing to deliver on it really pisses people off.

Tesla has created some of the best mass produced cars to ever hit the road. But, it's unbelievable that he's saying that FSD will be feature complete in 2020. Elon has taken control of FSD. He has the vision and he will deliver. 

This opportunity is a hundreds of billions of dollars. The people on the FSD team must be pumped.","Elon Musk: Tesla Full Self-Driving in early access this year, without supervision next year - Electrek "

How many accidents are truly a trolly problem, and how many are the result of an unexpected condition?

How often do sedan brakes fail unexpectedly? Why would an SDC be driving recklessly? How often would the system really have a choice on who it kills if it's going to kill? 

More than likely, fatal accidents will occur when the SDC cannot see or identity what is in front of it. It doesn't matter how many times you set the trolley problem if it thinks the little kid in the road is an unavoidable raccoon. The trolley problem has basically never happened in the last 250 years.

People love having debates about ethics instead of asking if a Waymo car can turn left onto a main road. The reality is that an SDC will do one of two things when faced with such a choice.

A) Brake heavily to minimize the impact on the current legal course.

B) Swerve only if there is a safe option to avoid any accident.

THE CAR WILL NEVER INTENTIONALLY CHOOSE TO DEVIATE FROM ITS CURRENT LEGAL COURSE IN ORDER TO HIT SOMEONE ELSE!

If so, You've just gone from an accident to manslaughter (or attempted). These articles get worse by the year.

This one, the author doesn't even know what the trolley problem is (might want to check wikipedia for 2 minutes before publishing an article), then spends the whole rest of the article talking about totally trivial questions on SDC known by everyone for the last 10 years. The version of the Trolley Problem that is formulated like, “Would an SDC run over a baby stroller or a group of nuns?” is absolutely ridiculous and not really worth considering.

But I think we’re too quickly dismissing the heart of the problem which is a determination on the value of life.  A more realistic scenario that will actually happen might be something like, “There’s a dog in the road.  Does the SDC swerve to try and avoid it?”  Knowing that swerving can be a dangerous maneuver for the driver.  Heck even slamming on the brakes can be dangerous at times.  What about on slick roads?  How does that reaction change if it’s a deer?  Or a chipmunk?  Or a paper bag?",Trolley problem is useless

If I was Comma, I'd be hoping Tesla's approach is very publicly successful. Having the same software stack and workable product would make them a great acquisition target. If you really want to solve the software problem you'll need to do the hardware. Best bet is to partner with a hardware company at that point.

You get dirty looks from taxis AND Uber/Lyft drivers alike. Ha ha ha. Would definitely suggest trying it out. The people inside explain what the car is doing and it is actually very educational. Oh and you don’t need to leave a tip as it’s a car who drove you. LOL Oh man last time I was there I agreed to the terms and crossed my fingers but no luck. I think it's an Aptiv car just using Lyfts platform for finding rides. Lyft has 2 long term goals for their L5 project: 
1) to provide a platform for autonomous ride hailing to third party companies like Aptiv, Ford, Hyundai. They focus on the car and autonomous driving, Lyft focuses on better ride matching and routing. 
2) to make their own L5 SDC. They control everything in this part.

Calling it a ""report"" is a huge embellishment- it's a marketing soundbite. ie, driving on the highway is safer than driving on crowded city streets that have traffic lights and level crossings. I think you guys are underestimating how much people use autopilot on surface streets. It requires constant supervision, but it's capable of doing 99% of driving without intervention. I just stop for lights and take care of turns. I don't think Tesla is excluding those miles, and I can see how they're easily 9x safer. It also says it’s about 3x safer than it was a year ago.

Edit: no idea how I misread that. It’s about 45% safer than a year ago. Did no one in here read the second paragraph of the article.

It clearly addresses what you think are witty comments... There is a lot of hate here, mostly thrown at Tesla when it should have been at the blog for stretching 2 sentences in a quarterly update into a blog post, but the Apples to Apples comparison you **can** make is- Autopilot has improved its safety record quarter on quarter to have one accident for every **4.34** million miles, vs one accident for every **3.27** million miles in Q2. A **33% increase.** In the past, Tesla would say that Autopilot has so many miles per ""accident"" while NHTSA reported so many miles per ""crash.""   They have not been willing to clarify what that means.

The new report -- which I have asked about again -- says ""accident"" for both but seems to follow on from the same numbers as before.

This is very important.  If NHTSA is reporting accidents reported to police, and Tesla is measuring something else, like airbag deployments or accelerometer triggers, you may not be able to compare them. But AP also exposes driver to cyber attacks
https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/06/27/researchers-fool-tesla-3-navigation-system-with-gps-spoofing/ Apples are also 9x safer than oranges For anyone that doesn't want to read the article to catch a couple caveats or look any further to capture them yourself:

No.  It isn't. Shurely Tesla has data from both their autonomous cars and their user-driven cars.

It should be fairly simple to compare trips in large cities like Los Angeles where there are a lot of Tesla owners. They should have the data they need to say how a human driven model 3 fairs on the 403 during rush hour compared to a autopilot driven model 3 on the 403 during rush hour. Interesting because my wife now refuses to let me put on AP in our Tesla because of how scary its driving is.

I'm not aware of anyone seriously pursuing it.  V2V has a mass deployment problem. In order for it to be worthwhile to develop, enough cars already on the road need to support it. /u/bradtem has written a [lot](https://ideas.4brad.com/tags/v2v) on the subject. This kind of technology does exist, but I cannot remember it off the top of my head right now. It's an open standard that uses short range radio. but at the moment and for the first future we don't need this technology because we already have the existing infrastructure in place in order to drive. Lol @ ""advancement of block chain technologies"" Not only to each other but to the infrastructure as well. As El_Pinguino mentioned V2V is Vehicle to Vehicle communications. V2I or V2X is abbreviated as Vehicle to Infrastructure & Vehicle to Everything. The thing is that there is a tiny portion of roads with this kind of tech at the moment. Another term could be called Geofenced but that's a whole other story. Check out what went on in Ann Arbor for a few years. The video is a little dry, but this will start you down the rabbit hole.

Ultimately that’ll probably be replaced with cellular V2X based on 5G, but that’s still some years away. V2V is the term for the short-range, low latency communication, and not many players use it.

If you say it can do something, you need to be able to own up to it. Surprised it took them that long to say this. Several vendors -- Daimler, Volvo, Google and others, said this many years ago, because it's the only thing you actually could do.   Nobody is going to get into a car and tell it to autodrive if they will be liable if it crashes while they are reading their book.

Which is why I found it silly when, for several years in the early days, people would stand up and say, ""The big question is, who is liable in an accident?""  It was never a question.  Robots are never liable, only people and companies are.

Of course, today, everybody gets up and says, ""the big question is, who does the car decide to kill when it has to kill somebody?"" which is even more idiotic, though I think this question is starting to fade a bit -- fortunately. Isn’t this mostly the case already for human driven vehicles? In a car accident directly due to a failure of the vehicle (not due to negligent maintenance) doesn’t the auto manufacturer accept liability? It makes sense, there arn’t many autonomous car accidents and those that do happen are usually not the car’s fault. When the car does make mistakes this just incentivizes the company to fix that mistake so it never happens again. I believe that Tesla still says you're responsible for driving. Maybe that will change. unlike Tesla, who will probably claim FSD but with the fine print that humans must be paying attention 100% of the time and ready to override at any moment. And any crashes Tesla will blame the human. There is no other choice really, I will let my car drive itself always when I'm drunk. So I don't remember any facts from the accident This just pushed full SDC out many more years.

Traditional auto companies now accept the demise of ICEmobiles because they can no longer compete with EVs for efficient and benign use of energy. That puts them in a head to head race for advantage in the race and billions are being invested to pick the survivors from also rans. I think most agree level 5 will not happen in the next few decades. 

The answer to level 4 depends on who you ask and how you define it. Waymo allegedly has vehicles with no driver in the mix in Arizona, Tesla will be driverless sometime between 2016-2020 depending on what mood Elon is in. It would help if you could rephrase your question based on what you want the car to do and not use the SAE levels which are extremely problematic to use and understand.  As an example, I'll throw out some common wants and maybe one will be close enough to match what you have in mind for your question:

> When will I be able to buy a car that can drive for me and I can sleep or read a book on the way to work or on a trip?

This is a ways off as in decades.

> When will I be able to buy a car that will drive for me while I make sure it doesn't make a mistake?

Right now only Tesla is working on this problem on a car that you can buy.  They state their cars will drive you around town and the highway next year but you will still need to pay attention.  They have been a bit more vague on when you will not need to pay attention but experts say tend to agree it will be decades.

> When will I be able to buy a car that will drive for me on highways and still require I pay attention?

You can buy these now.  Tesla has the best one but there are half a dozen other manufactures making good progress on this.  In the next few years you should have lots of choice.

> When will I be able to take a robo taxi with no driver

Waymo is already doing this buy only in Phoenix and a few other test cities.  In the next few years, depending on where you live, this has a good chance of being possible for you. It is better to ask ""when will driverless cars be invented"".

The Brookings Institute estimates automakers have spent an estimated $80 billion on autonomous vehicles so far

Driverless cars are 3 years late and some say a breakthrough is needed.

I think I've heard other people make this argument, but your article put it in a much clearer light and I have to say this could be a significant issue.  We've seen protests that have tried to block streets, but this is highly risky for the protester and eventually the drivers quickly win because of the imbalance of power.  This is completely flipped with robo cars.  While there are cameras, that is easily solved by wearing a mask.  A single protester could snarl all of Atlanta by blocking off 285 even for 20 minutes if most cars were autonomous.

&#x200B;

\>To clarify what “feature-complete FSD” means in this context, Musk later described multiple levels of Tesla’s assessment of self-driving tech, and specified that this meant cars are “able to be autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.”

&#x200B;

This one is by the end of the year for **EARLY ACCESS** but he said that it's tentative and it can slip to Q1 2020.

He said by the end of next year(end of 2020) TESLA they think it will not require **supervision or intervention.**

Afterward, it will be up to regulators to agree and actually enable tesla to release it without actually requiring supervision. Elon says a lot of things about timelines.

None are true. Bs. We are a mere 70 days until the end of the year. Not going to happen by then. At Autonomy Day (April 2019), Elon said that there would be robotaxis on the road with no one in them, next year. 

At the end, in the context of “feature complete FSD by the end of 2019” a journalist asked Elon specifically if he meant Level 5, and he said yes.

If Elon/Tesla are now going to move the goalposts and try to claim that FSD is/was always just a Level 2 feature, then they should be called out and held accountable for that.

As a side note, the reason why the SAE levels exist is to provide an industry-wide taxonomy with clear definitions. Without them, each company could just use a bunch of meaningless buzzwords like this:

> To clarify what “feature-complete FSD” means in this context, Musk later described multiple levels of Tesla’s assessment of self-driving tech, and specified that this meant cars are “able to be autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.” The Smart Summon's update will tell if it's just BS again. ""feature complete"" is common software speak for ""technically all the feature are there, but they're not guaranteed to work."" In the context of a self-driving car, I mean it's great progress, but it doesn't mean you can be asleep at the wheel.

[https://youtu.be/ng4241qGmaA?t=1320](https://youtu.be/ng4241qGmaA?t=1320) 50 years seems a bit strong Yes easily.  What Tesla isn't saying, though, is it will require human oversight and will make mistakes requiring the human to take over. Zoos CEO estimate is even more absurd than Elon’s He said that last year. My personal estimate is 2025. [deleted] Musk literally said the same thing, that by 2017 Teslas would be driving themselves and nobody holds him to task for his unreliable predictions Was it last year it was meant to drive itself coast to coast, this year was meant to be feature complete, i’ll ignore the 3 months, 6 months definitely tweet which was meant to be in 2017. So no.. it won’t happen next year, certainly not in anything approaching a sensible way. Hopefully my Model 3 will still be getting software updates in 50 years then. Sure, they can probably drive themselves with no human next year. It's one thing to state that. But it's another to claim the safety rate of those FSD features. Based on the autopilot deaths and Summon crashes, I doubt Elon's tech will be safe. Why is Elon so shit with predictions? Don't get me wrong I think he'll pull this shit off looking at what he's already done but he's always way too low with his estimates for time schedules. Do I really need to remind people of Elon's bs?

Literally last year he said in a year they will be able to self deliver cars to customer's doors with the only hold up being regulators. Ofcourse that didnt happen.

He's so full of it that when pressed to add driver monitoring in April of this year. He got mad and yelled at his interviewer and his response was that it's pointless and stupid because by the end of this year AP will be so good that ""having human intervene will decrease safety.""

We are at the end of the year and yet nothing. This guy has proven that he will say and make up ANYTHING to sell cars... Over and over again.

**December 2015:** ""We're going to end up with complete autonomy, and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.""

**January 2016:** ""In \~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY""

**June 2016:** ""I think we are less than two years away from complete autonomy, safer than humans, but regulations should take at least another year,"" Musk said.

**March 2017:** ""I think that (you will be able to fall asleep in a tesla) is about two years""

**Nov 15, 2018:** ""Probably technically be able to (self deliver Teslas to customers doors) in about a year then its up to the regulators""

**Jan 30 2019:** ""We need to be at 99.9999..% We need to be extremely reliable. When do we think it is safe for FSD, probably towards the end of this year then its up to the regulators when they will decide to approve that.""

**April 12th 2019:** ""I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least six months.... I think this was all really going to be swept, I mean, the system is improving so much, so fast, that this is going to be a moot point very soon. No, in fact, I think it will become very, very quickly, maybe and towards the end this year, but I say, I'd be shocked if not next year, at the latest that having the person, having human intervene will decrease safety. DECREASE! (in response to human supervision and adding driver monitoring system)"" GMT, General Musk Time. Always 10 years ahead of reality. Context is key. A Ford Model T could ""drive itself."" Just put it in gear and plop a brick on the accelerator. It will ""drive itself"" all the way to the first tree or lake or whatever. Teslas currently ""drive themselves"" a lot more intelligently than that, but it's not what most people think of as ""driving themselves."" Functional equivalence for that statement would be the kind of autonomy aircraft have, but that's not really 100% autonomy. In truth, to be fully and 100% autonomous, the car would practically need to be sentient. If Tesla already had it figured out ( zoox guys says  2 years) then there goes all their funding... I'm not saying Teslas will drive themselves next year, but the only thing notable that Jesse Levinson has done in his career has been to make a photo app that currently has [3/5 stars on the app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pro-hdr/id347104281).

I'll listen to his opinions when Zoox starts making profit. Makes me really sad that so many people are talking about it and nobody actually understood(or heard) what he said.  


He said if you are not using lidar and radar, then just using cameras and with the current estimates of the development in the field of computer vision, it would take 50 years. and by 50 years he meant it can't be done in the next year or so without lidar and radar  


He didn't say FSD will take 50 years to develop.  
The man has a PHD from stanford under Sebastian Thrun   
and FYI he is CTO not CEO Elon is a modern day con artist. Zoox’s next board meeting is going to be real interesting. VCs have 5-10 year exit plans, not 20-50. Musk is probably talking about Tesla driving itself from door to door but requiring full human attention ready to override. No chance. At least Elon is great at setting an aggressive goal and funding effective teams working towards the goal. Some people don’t like working to aggressive goals and they go work for Zoox. They said his electric car would fail. He couldn’t build a reusable rocket. That payments outside of banks wouldn’t work. That tunnels couldn’t be cheap. He couldn’t build a truck that was all electric. At what point do you figure out this is a person that strives to prove you wrong [removed] He need 50 year more progress. How is that even a sentence is he speaking English? >will drive themselves with no human input next year

They already do (smart summon), just not always very smartly.

""Driv themselves with no human input everywhere a Tesla can be currently driven by a human?"" -- may easily take 50 years or more. Tesla is also suing Zoox I am not a STEM person whatsoever, but it seems that what it will take to get driverless cars going is the IOT being embedded in 'smart streets'. When they put 5G sensors in every traffic light, every milepost or sign above a freeway, *then* there will be enough data for AI to deal with inclement weather, icy streets, etc.","“Elon Musk says Tesla vehicles will drive themselves with no human input next year.

thesis: comma is building a sustainable company; waymo, cruise, zoox, aurora, argo, etc. are not.
* **unit economics:** comma's fleet is as large as any of those listed (and growing quickly), but comma makes money from each car added, while the other companies all lose money. even when (if?) they start removing safety drivers, each waymo / cruise vehicle has an enormous up-front cost that needs to be repaid, and ride-sharing is not a particularly profitable business.
* **focused choice of vehicles:** comma is delivering value to users right now, supporting 5 of the top 10 cars in the U.S, while other companies are all relying on heavy customization of specific niche cars (and, in Zoox's case, building a car from scratch).
* **focused company setup:** comma is 13 people, focused tightly on the self-driving software problem. other listed companies are huge, with all of the accompanying overhead. this would make sense for established, profitable companies, but does not make sense for companies burning VC cash. comma's priors are that the big obstacle to full self-driving is software, specifically software _research_ (creative new tech, not just better engineering of existing tech), so comma's team structure is much more appropriate.

**context:**

this post is (partially) in response to the news that [Zoox is trying to raise even more money](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dl69c2/zoox_raises_200_million_to_build_selfdriving_car/), which comma [was surprised by](https://twitter.com/comma_ai/status/1186456081733545984).

---

**comma and tesla vs everyone else:**

for the most part, comma's arguments also apply to Tesla; Tesla's AV team is a (comparatively; ~100 autopilot engineers vs hundreds or thousands for other companies) small team, focused on building software for popular cars (models s,3,x). Tesla's software is providing value to customers every day, and already makes Tesla money.

it's also noteworthy that dolgov (waymo), urmson (aurora), salesky (argo), levinson (zoox), and vogt (cruise) all worked on darpa challenge teams. they have a ton of experience, but they are also (potentially) all making the same mistakes; building avs that are expensive, hand-tuned, and narrowly targeted towards a golden set of environments, since that's what won darpa.

karpathy (tesla) and geohot (comma) don't have this background, which is why the tesla/comma stack looks very different from the others. ""don’t be a map maintainer and don’t hand-engineer feature spaces"" is antithesis to darpa approach... /u/sannydo got a mention. I don't see how they advance their product unless they build a sensor suite.  At some point their system needs 360 vision, plus other sensors. How with the current approach can they do that?  I believe they can build as an ADAS system at least as good as mobile eye. I just don't see how they get any further, without ramping up hardware development, and that requires a bigger more expensive team. 

They'll have to build something that goes on top of the car with sensors that see all around. It's going to be pricier and harder to install then their current system. Might also be ugly. Say it costs 5k. That is what Tesla charges for FSD, so a 5k after market that promises the same thing might sell. However, can a team of 13 people building it and getting it manufactured. 

Designing something to go on the outside of the car is a bit harder than the inside. I wish them luck. Honestly, a solid argument for why Comma is better use of resources.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, though. It seems that Comma is well on its way to developing a super advanced level 3, while Cruise and Waymo are going for level 4. This is such a troll post. Why spend so much time on the competition, especially when the named competitors are going for a different line of business (taxis) ? If your software is so great, sell it to some OEMs instead of having people do aftermarket installs. Very interested to see how end2end this stack looks.",A 100x Investment (Part 1) (Comma.ai)

Unfortunately, it is evident this article was written by a salesperson rather than an engineer, judging from the many factual inaccuracies that undermine this article. For example,

> The maximum ranging distance of ToF is limited by eye-safety standards. 

FMCW lidar's maximum ranging distance is also limited by eye-safety standards. The signal to noise ratio is directly limited by optical power, which is limited by eye-safety standards. 

> Time-of-flight lidar works great at night, but during bright daylight photons from the sun interfere with the signal creating noise in the received signal.

This is a very minor concern. Even a certain brand of ubiquitous yet highly disliked pulsed lidars, notable for being very poor at rejecting interference, work fine during the day. For those units, you may get some spurious points if you point your lidar directly at the sun but those are easily filtered out with even the most basic of algorithms.

> However, range performance is proportional to peak power in these systems and splitting the available energy into multiple pulses causes range performance to drop.

The first part of the sentence is not true, your range still goes up when you emit more pulses, without having to crank up the peak power. Geiger-mode lidars (such as Argo/Princeton Lightwave), for example, emit a train of many pulses, since the probability of detection may be quite low for each pulse. However, it is true that a single strong pulse is better than multiple small pulses. Perhaps a quote from the _SPIE Field Guide to Lidar_ is better at explaining the drawback of weak pulses compared to heterodyne detection:

> For the well-designed heterodyne detection receiver (with sufficient LO power), the SNR is proportional to the number of photons received, even when the signal is very weak; whereas, for the direct detection receiver, the signal hitting the detector must be strong enough that its shot (photon) noise dominates all other noise. --- Paul McManamon, page 34, _SPIE Field Guide to Lidar_

Another drawback of sending many weak pulses is that, if the pulse train is too long, you can get motion blur as your target may have moved.

Anyway it is useful to point out the advantages of direct detection compared to FMCW:

* FMCW is more expensive and bulky because it may require a high quality laser oscillator, e.g. from a fiber laser, instead of cheaper, smaller pulsed diode lasers or VCSELs.
* Since laser oscillators may be expensive but high-performance, you could be stuck with solutions that do beam steering with only one or more lasers instead of large arrays of many lasers. This fundamentally limits the possible angular resolution and range, and introduces nontrivial motion distortion during the scan.
* The more coherent your laser, the more susceptible you are to speckle noise.

And for fairness I can also point out one other advantage of FMCW lidar that the author neglected to mention:

* Many FMCW designs are monostatic, meaning the receiver and emitter share the same aperture. This can result in simpler optical design and beam steering compared to bistatic designs. Furthermore it can improve close-range performance since some bistatic designs suck at close range due to the offset between the two lenses.

Another fact that many Doppler lidar proponents forget is that, while velocity is nice, the better your lidar is at measuring velocity, the worse it is at measuring range. You can't be good at measuring both, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.",FMCW: The future of lidar

https://discord.comma.ai/ Just to be clear for everyone, when the Civics recently changed from Nidec to Bosch, they lost the ability to have longitudinal control by OpenPilot. The hatchbacks have always used Bosch and never had ""OP long"" just like my Accord. Also, the point at which OP stopped steering (lateral control) dropped from 12 to 2 MPH. 

I love stock ACC in my Accord, and I get to enjoy features every day that are still being developed for cars with OP long, such as selectable following distances. Of course there are other features that will eventually come to cars with long control that I will never see, but the point is to consider what you want today vs what you hope to get in the future. 

That being said, I do hope you're aware you'll need to help it execute turns that you think it should be able to make. And it will complain loudly about not being able to make certain turns before executing them just fine.

Ask away if you have questions.","Question about OpenPilot and stock ACC I have a 2019 Honda Civic.

Can you leave the stock ACC on for speed/breaking while using Comma/OpenPilot lateral control at the same time?

For companies it would be worth it to ensure its better than an alert human, but beyond that who knows. Your scenario is not really relevant as the ped is still super far away. The SDC (or any other ADAS system) won't do anything. The ttc is pretty much gigantic and too much can happen until the situation gets critical. Current sensorsetups are often not even looking that far into the distance.


There is a NCAP test with an occluded child running from behind a car. That's when the detection and processing delay comes into play. To give a realistic idea.. 100 ms detection, 100 ms processing, 200 ms braking.
You can calculate a time to steer by yourself but depending on the scenario, hitting the brakes is the way to go.

Based on my experience, LIDAR based vacuums are hands down better at navigating the home, they do it with much more precision and confidence.

Also keep in mind that programming for LIDAR is so much easier than using computer vision. You could navigate using LIDAR without using any type of AI whatsoever. The lidar-equiped [Xiaomi vacuum cleaner is superior to the Roomba 980](https://smarthome-hometech.com/xiaomi-mi-robot-vacuum-cleaner-vs-irobot-roomba-980/) even while being much cheaper. [removed] Lidar costs more than entire roomba,  roomba moves at like 1mph. Roomba does not need to make split second decisions of life and death consequence. Roomba can be 90% accurate in path planning and still be a decent product. Two completely different classes of products. Technology just keeps getting cheaper and more powerful.

more information is better than less.

so if lidar and camera give more info when combined than either does alone, then in the long run when both cost mere pennies why not have a hybrid system? I don't understand the argument that vision ""it's good enough for humans"". Sure, but almost nothing in machine learning works the way humans do. 

Computers learn to drive by training on millions of hours worth of real and virtual road conditions. Humans learn to drive over a summer practicing in a parking lot when they're 15. Things aren't necessarily going to map 1:1 You can't \*just\* use cameras for self driving. Something else, such as LIDAR or RADAR should be used as a backup just in case the cameras become obstructed, or the cameras don't recognize an object. Sorry new here.  What is the main argument for Lidar?  It seems intuitive that if humans have been driving using mostly vision then vision should be all that is really needed in terms of sensors.  Unless there is something fundamental about the cost of vision inference computation Lidar seems like a stopgap for some of the currently difficult to solve problems with vision.  I also can read, so just link me the best Lidar argument if you don't want to explain something that has been explained over and over again. Apples to oranges. It's not that vision cannot achieve FSD. It's a matter of which one will be redundant and safer for everyone involved: lidar+cameras or just cameras?

My advice... make the bet about the last specific part above and not about the SAE Level. (If you leave it as Level 4, you will likely lose.)

Also specify what “unassisted” means. Are you allowing a human in the driver’s seat who just has to not touch the pedals/wheel for the duration of the trip? Or do you require an empty driver’s seat? I would but I spent that money on FSD for my car 😁 You are describing your skepticism toward vision-only navigation, but when you write this:

It seems like you believe that *some other* model will be able to do this in 4 years. 

Which I'm pretty skeptical about.

If your bet is really about vision, shouldn't you be betting that a vehicle equipped with some other sensor can pass your level 4 test, while a vision-equipped vehicle can't? This is an awesome move and I applaud you for it. Maybe offer to bet smaller amounts, you might get a taker at some lower level, not everyone has $5k to lose. [removed] > that current gen Tesla model 3 

To be honest, I think that Waymo could make a better lidar-less self-driving system than Tesla in less than a year if they wanted to. Perception is just one part of their self-driving system, and not the hardest one according to Waymo. Will this not result in another parallel universe? 

In one, some insist that driverless cars exist. In another, every Waymo car has a driver and the driver keeps grabbing the steering wheel. Moreover, a Waymo ride is no cheaper than an Uber ride and the passengers are not allowed to record a video inside the car. Does this skepticism only apply to vision-only full self driving, or would you make the same bet about vision+lidar 4 years from now? Also, technically Tesla Model 3 does not use vision-only, since it uses radar as well. I own a model 3...... and that’s not a bet I’m willing to make ha. Too specific. 
Why a Tesla?
Why a home?
Why NYC to Boston?

That’s a lot of qualifiers to accept for a bet about a general use of a tech. 

It should be
Any vehicle
Any location
Any fully autonomous trip from CBD of one major metropolis to another, because, let’s be honest the tech is already there for the highway part. > I'm 99% convinced that vision only navigation is not achievable anytime in the near future. 

That's the only way I drive. Of course it will be ""able"" do.   People can do that sort of thing today, have done it for quite some time.  The important point is being able to do that while causing an accident of any type less than once per 100,000  miles, ideally much less.   You are going to lose your money the way you specified the bet. With those strict requirements, no method of sensor will able to achieve that.

Most of the hard part of self driving is dealing with something AFTER it senses something. If lidar or vision sees a mattress on the road, what will it do? What about a cardboard box? Some things it can run over, other things it can’t. Some scenarios require swerving, others hard braking. What if someone is not allowing a car to squeeze in? What if a person suddenly cuts in a tight space?

The computer/AI part is the hard part, and with the requirements described in your post, nothing will be able to achieve that in 4 years. Maybe 10 years.","Tired of empty debates let's put up some money. I'm 99% convinced that vision only navigation is not achievable anytime in the near future.

Smart Summons is a neat trick that can also be useful but requires constant oversight.  Clearly Tesla has a lot of edge cases still left to be solved before that oversight can be removed.  They are a long way off from the truly driverless car they are supposedly releasing by end of next year. It's a product released in beta for the sole purpose of collecting massive amounts of data to improve the system.  On that front, it's doing exactly as it was intended. Interesting!

It's clear you need a map of the parking lot. Not necessarily a stored map, but at least one you are creating on the fly. You also need domain knowledge, like there will be a way to get to the driver, even if it's not obvious, so I should drive around and create a map and try to solve the problem. 

Honestly, I've always wanted to solve this problem in a different way. You need to understand the environment beyond the vehicles sensors, so raise the sensors. Use a small drone that gets launched to see the lot from an overhead view. Drone, isn't needed for most driving, but from overhead you can probably understand a parking lot, and predict movement of people and cars very easily. You launch it in parking lots or around construction or an accident.

On the other hand maybe you can do a grid to vehicle thing where there are cameras everywhere and any vehicle can tap into the video of feed. Processing is still all done on board, but you can always grab a camera feeds from around the lot or from around the corner, to add an additional sensor.  Also a simple camera feed is hard to hack, because it'll cause a huge mismatch in situational awareness, at worse the car just wouldn't move, it wouldn't crash. I also watched many videos of Smart Summon- at best it ""kinda, sorta"" works and it's a cool trick to show off.  At worst, its a hazard.

Please give him some support!

To answer the question, NO there is no actual camera stop sign detection (check video at 1:30 mark) only stop sign detection based off of GPS. However there is camera stop light detection but only when Tesla has specified a stop light exists on the map I didn't know Tesla even did anything with intersections even based on GPS yet.  Interesting. From my understanding they’ve had the detection going on in the background for a while now, but it’s only so they can collect data for AI learning purposes. 

I’m guessing they’ll slowly keep improving it for quite a while with just the warnings until it is actually good. Would be quite dangerous otherwise. Look, my semi can detect speed limit signs and display them on the dashboard with a little police strobe bar over them if I'm speeding. If my diesel drinker can do it, a Tesla can probably do better. Doesn’t look like they’re necessarily using GPS, though, as the road ends after the intersection. It could instead simply be detecting the end of the drivable road ahead. As far as I could tell, the on-screen warning said nothing about a stop sign in that case. BuT hD mApS arE a CruTch

Even if parking is $5/hour, good luck running a car, especially on city streets, for $5/hour. No one currently has a self driving car. In theory, car ownership would go down with self driving cars since the price of getting a ride would go down. 

But in theory, yes, you could have you car drive around and wait for you. This is no different than what happens already, just in reverse. Right now you drive around looking for a spot to park. So it’s not ideal either way. 

What is also very possible is you side your self driving car off to give other people a ride while you run your errand. This allows it to be productive while you don’t need it. Another option would be to have it park further out where parking is free if your errands will take more than just a few minutes. 

How self driving cars will impact cities will be interesting to observe once self driving cars exist beyond extremely limited trials. >I'm wondering if any drivers of self-driving cars on this sub already do this?

The latest video about Waymo cars shows a guy grabbing the steering wheel 35 seconds into the video: https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/dgwhdy/12_news_arizona_video_waymo_cars_going_completely/ I don't think this will be a problem.  Wasting energy, extra wear  and tear will not be preferred to just parking. [https://ideas.4brad.com/no-cars-wont-circle-around-traffic-avoid-paying-parking](https://ideas.4brad.com/no-cars-wont-circle-around-traffic-avoid-paying-parking) Musk mentioned Tesla’s going into like autonomous uber mode after dropping the owner off Well, kinda did this yesterday.  Dined at a restaurant last night where the first 4 rows right in front were reserved for Valet.  After dinner with Tesla’s new “Smart Summon” I called the car to come right up to the front of the restaurant to pick us up.

Yes, this whole concept will be reinvented over time.  Either cars can go self-park in parking lots further away for free rather than close up.  Or, as you eluded to and Elon’s “robotaxi” feature, the car can go off and make money while you’re dining or enjoying time without need of the car.

I do believe once cars “level 5” self driving cars are produced in Mass then the concept of vehicle ownership will change.  Owning a car will not be as cost effective as taxi/Uber driving wherever you need to go. SDCs represent such a massive shift in urban planning and transportation that there doesn't seem to be much point to me to try to extrapolate a single variable like this.

Basic questions like whether the nature of car ownership will change remain completely unanswered. Maybe rather than pay for your car to do nothing instead of parking, you could say ""Hey go do an hour of taxi work and then meet be back here""?.

You see what I mean. At any rate we'll have far more regulatory and market tools at our disposal when we have the data available on how everyone is actually using their cars. I'm sure some people will go berserk at the thought of the ""gubmint"" charging them an ""empty circulation fee"" when their car reports it, but luckily everyone hates traffic more than they hate paying for the things they use. :p Depending on how long you’ll be away from your car you could just have it go home.  There, others in your family could use it until you were ready.  If you were just visiting a place for an hour or less then you’ll need your car to park somewhere.

If this became a problem, I could see space sharing services.  So maybe I work at night, you could use my garage while I’m at dinner or in a store.  If I need my spot earlier than expected (or you stay longer than agreed) then I can kick your car out.","Why pay for parking when you have a self-driving car?

Does anyone know what Waymo actually plans?   Because their email could mean almost anything.  They could be planning to just add an extra 10 totally driverless rides per day (out of hundreds).  Or, maybe its 10%.  Or maybe 30%.

Pure speculation: they plan to have one or more managers manually selecting ideal circumstances to be driverless and then pulling the backup drivers for those occasions.   They might just manually pick times with light traffic and maybe routes that never have interventions.  They haven't got a specific target for how many drivers get pulled. 0:35 the guy is holding the steering wheel. ""The humans are being phased out.""

It’s worth mentioning that American safety standards are already setup like this. The National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The law establishes a self-certification process in which vehicle manufacturers  themselves certify that all their products are compliant with applicable FMVSSs.

Currently, NHTSA enforces the standards by purchasing motor vehicles (and motor vehicle equipment) from the marketplace and testing them for compliance.

It’s basically students grading their own homework with the teacher spot-checking and issuing hefty fines to the cheaters. There should be a public government mandated common simulation system that all builds are required to run through.  And the same but with real world tracks and tests for major builds or wide releases.

That would require the companies to create interfaces between their driving software and the public test harness simulation or whatever.  But without something like that then you do have the situation of the students grading their own homework.

Sure they are usually very cautious these days (except for Tesla) but it's still very early.  When self driving cars become normal and lots of companies and groups of varying ability and oversight start releasing systems into the wild, you are likely to see some major problems unless you have thorough and open verification of builds/deployments.

I'm not really expecting a government agency to be able to test all of the strange scenarios that, for example, Waymo might.  But we should have some validation that at least basic scenarios are covered by individual software releases and don't have regressions for simple things that we know about.

I mean you have already seen that in a few cases such as the Uber incident in which they actually did a release with major flaws in core parameters of the system, which basically disabled an important part of it and caused it to run someone over.  That was not even really an edge case, it was something basic that they had a regression on from modifying a variable before deployment.  Or the Tesla releases that could not see those trucks a certain height above the road. For DMV to give license to a person, DMV asks him to drive in some streets and try to expose him to a few “scenarios” . Based on the persons way of driving in these scenarios DMV can judge if he’s a good driver. 
Now for a self driving car, everyone agrees that a few scenarios won’t be enough to test in simulator/real world. This is because we can’t judge a self driving car by looking at how it reacted for a few scenarios and interpolate as it is not predictable for all cases.

I think NHTSA has two issues to solve with Simulated Miles based testing: 
1. How many scenarios do they have to brainstorm? Let’s just say NHTSA came up with 100k scenarios. If the self driving car passes all these scenarios in simulator then they say it is safe. What if there’s a new scenario that they haven’t looked at and caused an accident?
2. Even if the car passes on all 100k scenarios how to validate if the models that each company uses in simulator is accurate to real world sensor data? or how accurate the simulator is to real world scenarios?

For these two cases, they also need a real world miles data to get some confidence. But how many real world miles needed? Statistically I think trillions of miles. Only way I think is to have millions of cars driving for few years to get confidence on the safety level. >really difficult to make the test for [a self-driving vehicle] right now

Recent tests show that AEB systems fail at night. It is not very difficult to test the AEB systems at night! Tesla should be banned from saying ""appreciating asset"" and ""coast to coast driverless drive"" until Tesla cars pass the AEB tests at night.

Waymo cars should be required to test if the cars stop for a tree. Recent reports say Waymo cars get stuck in parking lots because the car waits for a tree to cross the road.

* Working with OEMs to support customers that still want to own their own cars. Subtle little dig at Tesla there: https://youtu.be/qJiFKxvJlhY?t=240 

Basically, 10 years ago they were on the verge of doing exactly what Tesla did: releasing a SAE level 2 product named ""autopilot"" for highway driving, but concluded in early tests that expecting humans to be constantly vigilant while autopilot was engaged was unrealistic in practice, and that as a result anything less than level 4 would be unsafe.","John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, speaks of company plans regarding self driving tech.

I’m guessing it’ll only be available on certain routes that they have high competence in? Or could it be any route? This is what I expected them to do last year.  I hope this isn't another paper launch and is the real deal and they are only a year behind. Where is the PR on this from waymo.  I fully expected a ""We have driven xx million miles and now we are going to take it one step further"" type of release from them. Thats odd, didn't they do a big thing about having this before the end of 2018? I assume this email went to Waymo One riders ? Yea?

Can anyone please confirm ? What to expect?  
A ""What to expect"" button which you can tap to learn more about what to expect. Exciting times! 

Competition is great. I think waymo sees the finish line and is now going to be sprinting to cross it. My daughter is thirteen and may never ever need to drive herself. Hello safer roads! The question is: are they going to have a remote driver just in case or are they going full-blown off the leash? This email literally says ""soon"".

No date is provided. I have a question for the waymo early riders :   when you request a car, do you have to tell where you wanna go before the car comes to you? Or do to tell it only once you are in the car?

If the car knows where you wanna go before coming to you it may means that they assign FSD only if you plan to go somewhere using a EASY road Where's the old /u/vicegripper here to say something about how this still isn't ""real self-driving""? 

Also, can we get a collective I told you so for all the other self driving naysayers consistently on here as well? I think it's well deserved at this point. All it takes is one of these killing a pedestrian to set us back a decade with regard to public opinion and policy on self-driving. I really hope Waymo isn't being overconfident, because they could fuck things up for the whole industry if they're not ready. Discussion here somehow copies the ""climate change"" deniers :-) Some people won't believe that the car is self-driving even if they eventually take a ride in it. They will argue that it is remote-controlled, that all other cars surrounding it are driven by company staff or that the windshields are actually hi-res displays simulating the ride etc. With Tech Crunch reporting that this came from Early Rider Program, that makes me think Waymo one (non-nda) won't be getting driverless rides soon.  This is likely just signaling they are about to scale up ERP driverless rides more significantly now.

Update: never mind We are right around the two year anniversary of when they started doing driverless tests and driverless passenger rides regularly.

I'd bet they start Waymo One rides without safety driver this quarter, before the end of the year.

And I hope they update how many millions of miles they have driven so far. Note that almost exactly two years ago, Waymo made a very similar statement:

>Waymo is now confident enough in its technology to dispense with a safety driver. The company has released a video showing Waymo cars driving around the Phoenix area with no one in the driver's seat:

>At first, most of Waymo's driverless cars will have an employee in the back observing the vehicle's behavior. If something goes really wrong, they'll be able to push the ""pull over"" button to stop the car. In the coming months, participants in Waymo's early rider program will start getting the option to ride in fully driverless vehicles.

>Some time after that, Waymo will launch a commercial driverless taxi service that's open to members of the general public in the Phoenix metropolitan area and beyond.

Again, just to be clear, all of the above came from an announcement Waymo made in **November 2017**.


https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/fully-driverless-cars-are-here/ I wonder how little this specific use case will effect how people get around. It’s like Waymo and similar companies expect everyone to suddenly sell their cars and just ride share autonomous vehicles. But why would they do that? They already have option of ride sharing, and having no driver in the car wouldn’t influence that much. People will still prefer owning their own car. This is why I think it’s more exciting to see other companies try and bring autonomy to cars you can actually own. And yet people insist on saying that SDCs are 10+ years away. What Waymo is doing is building the database of high resolution mapping from their lidar sensors which all autonomous vehicles will need access to. Ultimately it will be dynamically updated from the actions of many lidar equipped vehicles.","Waymo email to customers: ""Completely driverless Waymo cars are on the way"" "

Maybe they have to solve them to gain enough acceptance to eliminate them.  Most of the problem in SF seem to be crazy on street parking, most of which is unmetered.  At some point the city is going to remove all this free parking and the problem won't exist anymore.  This probably won't happen until price pressure from SDCs to lease these parking spots for pickups and drop offs happen.

It's way easier to get computers to read signs than it is to create a secure but almost universally updateable map or every sign, road cone, crossing guard, etc.  If you try and gateway the map through some official source then it won't get updated for all but the more permanent updates.  If you allow open enough access that everyone keeps it updated it will not be secure.  Even if you could somehow solve this, why would you go through the effort? Depends on how you are doing SDC.

If using a backing database like how Waymo is doing it the signs are not all that important.    They would be in the database.

So say a Stop sign fell over the Waymo cars would likely still stop at the intersection because of the backing database.

There is of course also Navya, working on smaller buses. Not economically interesting and buses are already crazy safe. 

In an Uber, you replace one driver per passenger with SDCs.

In a bus, you're replacing 1 driver per 30 passengers. The driver is just not that expensive per passenger, so there's a lot less to gain. [deleted] Tesla isn't quite ready for that type of navigation (I think Comma.ai never will). there are still intersections and turns. maybe in a couple of years. Waymo could probably do this now, maybe GM.

honestly, I have no idea why nobody is doing it. it's certainly easier than general taxiing, and they get the added benefit of potentially being subsidized by transit authorities (like buses do), as well as a foothold into the city so the transition from shuttle service to taxi will be smoother and more accepted. they could run smaller vehicles, which are cheaper per seat, so it would actually perform much better than existing buses. 4 mini-buses would carry roughly the same capacity, but cost roughly 1/10th as much. instead of waiting 10-20 min per bus, you could have them arriving every 2.5min-5min, which makes on-time performance much less critical and makes a much better overall service. you could also make every other or every 3rd bus an express that only makes the most common stops. the local route would still have 1/2 the wait time, and the bulk of people would get MUCH faster transportation. you could also offer hybrid routes, so maybe 2 shuttles run like they do now, 1 runs express, and 1 merges into an intersecting route, making a hybrid route that does not require a transfer. There are actually pilot programs in U.S. for this exact thing, a specific example is that University of Phoenix is working on using shuttles made by Local Motors that are fully autonomous to drive students around campus. 

There's also there's roaming demonstration project that was in Salt Lake City recently and moves around periodically, but the name escapes me. I'll try and find the names for these projects when I get back to my computer. 


There are pilots, but legal problems are rampant here, and the tech isn't simple. And the economic benefit is there, but not amazing.

Edit: I have been corrected, Olli is the name of the shuttle and it's made by Local Motors. I goofed. I've even toured their factory. Buses are too large to be efficient -- the average bus in the USA carries 9 people and uses more fuel per person than a typical car -- but self-driving can solve that by shrinking down to vans, since you don't need drivers.      Instead of 2 buses per hour on a line, put 10 vans and get far more ridership (and efficiency) because people feel much better about something that comes every few minutes.     But better still, have the vans work more ad hoc, taking people from where they are to where they want to go, rather than having fixed routes and schedules.   No changing lines.  Again, robots solve this problem. I'm surprised Tesla hasn't announced a city bus project yet. It could share a lot of components with their Semi and save cities an enormous amount in fuel and maintenance.

Literally all the self driving bus would have to do is stay in its lane (which Tesla and Comma Ai have done brilliantly) and not hit people (which with proper BRT infrastructure it is almost impossible for  people to ever have a conflict). So why is this not the lowest hanging fruit that companies are going after? Or am I missing a big company that is working on this?"

Ok, just read the article. Only 4 vehicles were tested (not every single car with a AEB system was tested here) and their pass/fail rate was 40/60... not great, but it really only shows what those specific 4 vehicles may or may not do. It also appeared to me that a couple of the vehicles did actually stop and/or slowed down upon impact. I think these tests are great and so are the safety systems, more tests are needed, and surely the systems can and should always be improved. I like the way that the legs move as the dummy “walks” across the street. anecdotally my 2019 Subaru Forester has served effectively in downtown dc.

i usually see the person in time to begin breaking but the car always acts quicker. AEB systems aren't designed to not run pedestrians over, they are designed so you don't plow into the back of a slowed traffic at full speed, you'll probably still run into the back of something, but not at such a high speed and your seat belts will be pretensioned before impact increasing the chances of the vehicles occupants surviving.

These are driver aids, not automated driving features and you would have to be a moron to rely on AEB to do your braking. [deleted] How exactly did the Camry get a ""Superior"" scores in the IIHS safety test for front crash prevention

Somewhat same scenarios with child walking from between cars, even in the dark.

Would love to see this system perform the same tests. Yup.  The point is ADAS comes from a different mindset.  Preventing 30% of pedestrian impacts is a huge win when you started at preventing none of them.

The robocar problem is completely different, and the companies who try to turn ADAS into robocars are on the wrong path.

Oh the possibilities! Just kidding OP good article. I live in Columbus, OH. It’s amazing how much space is dedicated to just parking. Every third building seems to be a parking garage, we have open parking lots downtown and so much space is dedicated to street parking. It will be a much better future when all the space can be reclaimed But that would double the traffic, wouldn't it? Now cars go to the city in the morning and go out in the evening. According to this idea, we'd also get a ton of traffic going the other way at both times. Autonomous or not, parking lots or not, people still have to exit and enter their vehicles. Normally we would walk to wherever we parked it and then leave from there. But soon (or now if you own a Tesla) the vehicles will come to us and that creates some unique problems. Part of the plan needs to be how vehicle spaces are designed, particularly those adjacent to businesses. One or two people summoning their vehicles is not a problem, but once everyone is doing it then we're going to see congestion as people wrangle in limited space for the convenience of avoiding some snow or rain, or a long walk back to the car. Where do the driverless cars park?  If there's enough to handle rush hour, there's going to be a lot of empty ones that need to park somewhere between busy times. They have been saying this since 2012.

Along with ""I am not teaching my kid how to drive a car because driverless cars will be here in 2017"". It will happen slowly. Cities already are trying to get rid of parking. This isn't a problem. I always find these prediction articles off base. It seems obvious to me that the first thing that will happen is that more cars will park in less space because they wont have to leave room for drivers to get in and out. I can't find any estimate on how many extra cars you could park door to door and nose  to tail if the SDC is doing the parking.

Also street parking would change because SDC could organize in a priority queue and be bumper to bumper making more space available. If by chance one in the middle needs to get out the queue would slink forward/backward and let that car out.

SDC are going to be expensive af when they come out. Largely taxi service anyway. We're going to have to incorporate more usage-based tolls on our roads. To drive on congested roads specifically, there should be a significant toll per-mile for cars with 0 passengers, and perhaps even a small fee for cars with only 1 passenger.   


If you want to avoid the tolls, you still have options: take a shared car/taxi (or van/suv, more likely), take roads that aren't as congested, shift your travel to off-peak hours, take public transit, etc. Interesting layout, although it assumed personally owned vehicles. I assume taxis aren't going to hunt for parking, although they'll still mess up parking revenue. Agreed. They go hand in hand. Improve zoning to limit parking and density while adding transit, bike lanes, etc Montreal is the opposite, less parking every year. In our defense, our public transportation is second to New York. Last year I bought a house and if I had a level 4 self driving car, I wouldn't have bought it in London. I would have bought 2 or 3 hours away. I don't think we have realized how much the world will change. There might not be any more downtown after self driving cars. Amsterdam is planning to remove 10,00 parking spaces in the city centre. This is happening in the next few years! No, they don't One thing I like about this article is that it considers the possibility that people will own their own self-driving vehicles. A lot of articles on this subject assume that everyone will be riding in automated Uber-style vehicles, but that will require a substantial price drop over what Uber costs today or a substantial price increase in owning your own vehicle.

As it is now, at least in most of the US and Canada, the distances are too far and the parking is too plentiful for a car service to completely take over from private vehicles. Where I live, an SDC service would have to be 1/5 of what Uber costs before it even starts to be competitive with a moderately-priced private vehicle. And a lot of people will pay a little more if they don't have to wait and don't have to ride in a shared vehicle. So that means parking is still going to be required, but it doesn't necessarily need to be close by or easy to access. They will have to charge for curb space and use crypto for micro-transactions. This is probably one of the biggest reasons cities will resist SDCs, the parking revenue. I can see Toronto holding out for a very long time. I hope so. Tesla's ""Robotaxi"" vision would eliminate the need for car ownership to get from A to B in cities, and it's further along than it seems:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/tesla-acquiring-deepscale-computer-vision-start-up-for-self-driving.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/tesla-acquiring-deepscale-computer-vision-start-up-for-self-driving.html) I can see a dystopia in the future where people go downtown for an even (restaurant, show, sports, etc). Parking is extremely expensive downtown, and it's actually cheaper to have your self driving EV roam around the city until your event is over to pick you up. So you'll have hundreds or thousands of driverless vehicles roaming around to kill time in the city, causing gridlock!",Driverless cars could spell the end for downtown parking – and cities need to plan ahead

I was just wondering if I should trust smart summon to navigate out of my garage and turn a tight corner in a shared parking lot. Looks like the answer is no. There was another shared on IG where the car quickly pulled into a golfing cart, they think the camera saw through the golfing cart. I am amazed she had the guts to try it in a garage like that. Also that garage is so clean. I know it will get better over time, but I hope Smart Summon performance doesn't become an issue. There was a Model 3 parked right the hell in the way in a parking lot today and it wasn't moving. The guy had to come and rescue it. Seeing how slowly the cars travel in this mode and how cautious it is, I can see how it would be infuriating if I was stuck behind one in a parking lot.

Because it's for open air car parks, preferably places the GPS and sensors can work and orient themselves properly.

Good lord. Who even knows where they summoned it from? It stops within like 5m of the device summoning it, she might have been so close already if she had the phone that it was trying to get away from her to hit that distance, and the wall looks sheer enough to maybe present a mapping problem for the lidar.

Anyone who thought that 1550 was a cure all and you could do whatever you wanted has a severe misunderstanding of how these things work. At 905 the lens focuses the light onto the retnia causing damage at relatively low pulse energy levels. At 1550 there is no focusing and the energy is absorbed by the eyes, but a high enough energy level will burn the cornia. This energy level is significantly higher than the energy level it takes to burn a retnia at 905. Atmospheric transmission is an entirely different discussion and talking about water absorbtion without discussing particle scattering is disingenuous. Allowing pump light to leak out of a 1550nm system is just lazy, there will always be some small amount, no beamsplitter coating is perfect, but it should never be anywhere close to eye damaging levels. That's not to say that some idiot manufacturer might not screw it up, but the FDA regulates these things, it's a simple test to measure the output, and should be regulated and tested on every device. 

The fact (physics) of the matter is that a 1550nm system will operate at a longer range than a 905nm system when both are eyesafe at the aperture.

The real issue with either is what happens with either when any sort of optics is between the eyeball/sensor and the lidar transmitter. Binoculars, or any other device that increases the effective aperture of the eyeball/sensor will decrease the eyesafe range, so while it still is ""eyesafe at the aperture"" it can cause still cause damage. That is the real safety argument against lidar.",Safety questions raised about 1550 nm lidar

I have no idea what engine they are using in the Tesla, but I can 99% guarantee that it isn't the problem as long as the car is outside.  The problem is Google maps can be wildly off in certain places.  My work is GIS related and so I spend a decent amount of time comparing $50k differential GPS locations to various satellite and aerial sources.  Most of what you see on Google maps is flown by plane without ground custom ground references.  this means they rely on existing highway and public markers.  They are also scanning way out to each side of the flight path and rectifying the image to look like it was flown directly overhead.  Unless you happen to be located directly above the actual flight path, this adds more error to the maps.  It's hard to say exactly but I would guess on average any given object on Google maps is 10 to 15 feet off actual ground location.

The next problem you have is the phone.  If you are telling the car to go to a certain point on Google then you just have the Google map error.  If you are telling it to come to you then you also have the GPS error of your phone.  iPhones are +/- 20 feet 95% of the time once warmed up.  The even worse part about phones is that they use various methods for location.  This is great for a lot of applications, but not if you need really precise positioning. These alternate sources like cell towers, WiFi, etc can be +/- 100 feet and most of the time the phone is using them to save battery life.  It can take 5 minutes to warm a GPS engine up and get all the locks it needs to get to the 20 foot 95% of the time accuracy. Doesn't seem very technical to me. Just comments from a technical guy.

I really want to know what the driver of the grey car was thinking 😂😂😂 Non Tesla owner here. How does the car know where you want it to specifically go to pick you up? Jesus a Costco and Home Depot in the same parking lot? Wtf some men just want to see the world burn That's really impressive. You gotta feel proud as fuck watching your car doing that in a parking lot. ""Look at this asshole Tesla driver, hurry the fuck up and make your mind up buddy""

*honks horn and overtakes, gets ready to give Tesla driver the death stare and shake of the head only there is no driver...* Tricky situation but it looks like it needs a lot of work still. Like the car should hug the right. It isn't the law in a parking lot, but it makes intentions clear to other drivers.

Generally in these situations, the driver is communicating information with their gaze, eyes, body language, shouting. The car cannot replicate these. So simply mimicking human approaches to this situation will not be enough. They will need to act differently from humans. And that is a VERY different machine learning task. Drives like it's got Florida plates on the car... Now the demand is going to be even more lop-sided for tesla vs other cars

In one update all models got this ability over night. And prospective buyers know this will continue. Can the Tesla honk if someone is going to pull into it? OMG these cars are going to be so annoying. If this is the Costco in sandy springs GA that parking lot is crazy busy. Awesome to see the summon behave so confidently. When i would have been in tesla would have honked on the white SUV. Like whats the holdup. That is almost hard to believe.  Maybe Elon's claims about what's coming soon aren't exaggerated.  It will be very interesting to see if it is this impressive most of the time.  

I'm curious - would you trust this enough yet to use it all of the time (without following the car)? Looks like everybody in that parking lot doesn't know how to drive, Tesla included. Swear to god Tesla just employs remote control drivers watching via the car's cameras and using a crappy joystick. Makes me wonder who gets sued if the car runs over and kills someone.  Obviously Tesla gets the first suit, but I have to believe that the (probably rich) owner also gets sued along with their insurance company(ies).  Also, can you get a ticket for this?  Who is the driver of the car in this case?  Tesla?  The person who hit summons?  So many questions... Impressive ! It navigated a difficult situation. The car is an appreciating assett. Is this the perimeter Costco in ATL? Very freaky, but very cool.  

The things Summon isn't programmed to do yet, put in bad light the amazing things it can do, like navigating around kerbs and parked cars, by making instant 3d maps of its immediate surroundings with cameras only, no lidar. This was thought by many to be impossible, yet Karpathy and team did it.

This is not the finished product but a very early version, the same way they figured kerbs they will figure the rest, like the path of moving cars, following lines and stay on correct side, etc. They must have thought most people would appreciate with a ""technical eye"" the amazing things Summon can do already, but people get hung on what it can't do and think it's clumsy and dangerous.

Unless Karpathy and team already solved the parts people complain about, and they're sending the updates in a few days, then it might be better to disable Summon for now. Then re-enable it when it's more developed.

Releasing it at this stage to the wide public, puts a great thing in a bad light. My Nan parking mode engaged Private lot owners prohibiting this shit in 3-2-1... So much dry steering... I've seen a lot of other videos where the car goes all over the place in smart summon so while I want to be impressed by this, I still have the feeling that this is more of a lucky shot than the standard average behavior. I feel like this could have turned really awkward at any point. Will be really cool to see them iterate and make this better though, hopefully the data from real world use cases helps with that. All I could think is the owner must have been nervous I would have been as the owner watching the car navigate this obstacle course. The owners liable for all the people in the lot and there actions, which are pretty unpredictable. Looks like it needs a lot of work. While impressive, you effectively just created all that traffic in the parking lot, good job. Tesla is going to make so much money on repairs. The data processing on this must be on overload but satisfying to see end result, well done Tesla! How many people didn't notice it was driverless? 

How many people don't bother trying to establish eye contact with the drivers as insurance when walking among cars? One of the most frivolous uses of self driving technology... Why do we need this? This is not making anyone safer or marginally improving their life... There's been a LOT of accidents of this, should have never been made for general release.

The other driver should be at fault, but the Tesla could have done more (and probably will in the future). Predicting the crash, honking and possibly reversing / stopping earlier should be enhancements to the algorithm. [deleted] [deleted] How’d the tesla not stop or honk quicker? That’s an easy one to avoid for a human driver. 

Fyi i love tesla, I’m not trying to be an asshole. Interesting case. Tesla should / will definitely improve their crash preventative measures, even if the Tesla wasn't at fault a simple honk on detection of the reverse lights and movement into the projected path would probably significantly reduce the accidents rate. Well it was bound to happen. Parking lots are dangerous. At least it wasn’t the Tesla’s fault here. This is why I would be nervous about using smart summon. Its not that I dont trust the Tesla, it's that I dont trust other drivers. Can’t wait for this to become a media frenzy about how unsafe advanced summon is. You're at fault. Tesla has already stated that the driver of the Tesla is 100% responsible for how they use Summon. Here's a close call accident that IT would had been at fault at.

While that backing vehicle doesn't have RoW, that was a remarkably stupid maneuver, sorry to say. Our world and insurance is not ready or setup to deal with driverless accidents, maybe this will help the industry finally address these issues. Good to see it wasn’t Tesla fault. Driver of the other car wasn’t paying attention. Note the Tesla short idiot jumping all over his tweet. They never eat or sleep, do they? I was just thinking about how insurance will cover AV incidents. I think that eventually the argument will have to be made that the person who owns the car isn't liable for if it crashes, but rather the manufacturer. It's for this reason that I think that car insurance will be done as major contracts between insurance companies and the AV producers, to shield them from lawsuits for things like this. This will also put the small insurance offices and agents out of work once they become more commonplace.

Of course when I told my boss in 2014 this (a State Farm agent) he thought it was ludicrous, but this will actually be a very important case for this precedent moving forward. The future is hurtling towards us! And thus, the struggle between man and machine begins. For anyone who thinks the Tesla was at fault here, I have a question. What if the roles were swapped? If it were a human driven car where the Tesla was and the Tesla backed into it, then who would be at fault?

I think framing it like this might reveal some biases.

Undoubtedly there was an opportunity for the Tesla to do this better and I'm sure they will in the future; honking, flashing lights, evasive maneuvers, etc. That said, I think we already have a tendency to expect more from the autonomous vehicles than we expect from humans. Plenty of human-driven cars have been backed into in the same way. The good thing is this can be a learning experience that all other cars can learn from. This feature should have never been pushed in its current form.
The other time I saw someone happy summoning his car while it clearly didn't respect a stop line, it only slew down instead of fully stopping. This will be treated like any accident. However who’s at fault is going to be tricky. “You” (the model 3) technically shouldn’t have crossed the traffic like that through parking spaces, but many people (not just Smart Summon) do this all the time too. Regardless, still technically illegal whether you’re in the seat or not.

As for them, they didn’t check before they backed up. My guess is both insurance are going to claim a percentage of the fault. Reality settles in..",Smart Summon accident on video

CNBC:

Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, is taking longer than expected to develop a commercialized product, leading analysts at Morgan Stanley to lower their valuation of the company by 40%.

In a report on Thursday, Morgan Stanley cut its valuation on Waymo to $105 billion from $175 billion, based a discounted cash flow analysis.

""Over the past year, there have been a series of hurdles relating to the commercialization and advancement of autonomous driving technology,"" the analysts wrote. ""Most notably, we underestimated how long safety drivers are likely to be present within cars and the timing of the rollout of autonomous rides-sharing services.""

Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car project, has made aggressive strides of late, receiving regulatory approvals, improving driving systems and partnering with other auto manufacturers. However, CNBC reported in August that Waymo's self-driving car efforts still rely heavily on human elements, including having safety drivers present in rides.

Morgan Stanley said the biggest factors in lowering its valuation are that the overall industry is developing more slowly than anticipated and that losses in ridesharing will continue mounting, largely because of the continuing need for safety drivers.

In terms of Alphabet's current value, Morgan Stanley has a price target of $1,450, which implies a market cap of about $1 trillion. That assessment values Waymo at about $20 billion, ""given industry uncertainty and investors' lower willingness to pay for cash-burning entities."" I agree with this, tbh. I've been increasingly bearish about Waymo as time goes on -- they seem to be inheriting all the problems with Google's culture (which makes sense as they're forked out and many of their employees are ex-Google) and are really struggling to get a launch out the door. They've got so much of the logistics figured out, yet they still do very limited rides and don't seem to have the confidence for a full scale launch even in a limited metro, with easy roads for that matter.

I'm a Xoogler and have some opinions about this that are influenced by things I saw there, along with conversations with Waymo folks. I've rooted for this project since back when it was in X, but I'm increasingly worried they're adding more cooks to the kitchen on a project that has fundamentally flawed components in one way or another, and it's going to be a long road before it gets out the door fully, much less in any cities. I would pin Cruise as potentially overtaking them, though I hear Cruise has some tech and culture issues of the same sorts. Who cares what Morgan Stanley thinks? They can make up any number they want and it doesn't matter. Waymo isn't public and isn't seeking outside investment. They should just read the news. Krafcik recently told in an interview that Waymo's timeline to set up SDC services on a larger scale is 4-5 years from now.  Waymo's ""problem"" today isn't the software any longer, it's the development of a vehicle system. Today, most people still think that SDCs will come as the ordinary cars they are used to, just with self-driving capability added. But that is not how the future will look like. Actually, it will look similar to this:

(sorry, german language article - just click through the pictures)

([https://www.canoo.com](https://www.canoo.com/) is the homepage of this company, but  design is, ehm, little bit weird)

PS: And forget about the ""safety drivers"". It's an easy way to tell competitors ""you still have time ..."" just by staffing safety drivers into some hundred cars. There is nothing to lose for Waymo by sticking to that policy. Not even sure why it is more than a few billion given they do not have a product anybody wants to pay money for.  Shit, maybe $500M.  It's cool technology that does not work.  There is no evidence yet that they can safely drive a car w/o a driver.

> *Available now on GitHub to facilitate the creation of groundbreaking autonomous driving innovations*

> Taipei, Taiwan, September 25, 2019 – VIA Technologies, Inc. today announced the availability of VIA-AI source code and documentation on GitHub for the global developer community. The VIA-AI app enables the addition of level 2 driver assistance capabilities by connecting an Android smartphone to the CAN (Control Area Network) bus of a vehicle.

> “Our mission with VIA-AI is to facilitate the development of driver assistance applications by making our technologies accessible to everyone,” commented Richard Brown, Vice-President of International Marketing, VIA Technologies, Inc. “We look forward to working with developers, enthusiasts, and industry partners to accelerate the creation of groundbreaking autonomous driving innovations.”

> **The VIA-AI Driver Assistance App**

> VIA-AI is an open source driver assistance app that supports Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), and CAN Bus integration functions. It enables the development of driver assistance capabilities for selected vehicles using a modern Android smartphone and hardware connectors.

> VIA-AI is compatible with current generation flagship Android devices, and verified for full functionality with HTC U11 and HTC U12+, and Google Pixel2 smartphones; other smartphone models are currently under evaluation. The VIA-AI app connects to the vehicle’s CAN Bus using a standard onboard diagnostics port (OBD-II) and a giraffe connector (available from comma.ai). Once installed, the VIA-AI app connects to the vehicle’s subsystem to manipulate acceleration, brake and steering functions, providing Level 2 driver assistance on the highway.

Also realize that all of these are being filmed because people want to show off their cool self driving car to their friends.

**But instead of a sensational headline, let's look at the facts.**

* The NHTSA states that 17250 car accidents are reported per day. [source](https://amaresq.com/blog/auto-accidents/how-many-car-accidents-per-day/)

* Of those accidents, approximately 1 in 5 happen in parking lots. [source](https://www.myparkingsign.com/blog/parking-lot-accidents/) which means there are 3450 parking lot accidents *each day* in the US.

* There are 268.8 million cars in the US. [source](https://www.quora.com/How-many-cars-are-there-in-the-US)

* Of those cars, 250,000 are Teslas. [source](https://www.statista.com/topics/2086/tesla/), which we'll call roughly 0.1% of all US cars.

So we should be able to extrapolate that 3 and a half teslas are involved in an accident in the US each day in a parking lot. Furthermore, I'd wager about 10 to 50% of tesla owners are actually using smart summon. So that 3.5 number drops to .3-1.5 accidents a day using smart summon.

We've seen one.

I’m just as excited for this update as the next person. But just so everyone who is not in the loop is clear:

>Those using Smart Summon must remain responsible for the car and monitor it and its surroundings at all times.

Excited to try it out! Talk about burying the lead:

>The addition of the video game ""Cuphead"" to the Tesla Arcade I find it really good especially compare to earlier versions. It will now in a totally empty parking lot find where the parking row ends based on the lines and stick to a side. Also sometimes used map data to drive the right direction on one-way parking lanes. That looks incredible! “KITT, come pick me up!” I wonder how well it works when there are a bunch of Summon-ing cars around. Imagine a basketball game letting out on a cold night and everyone wants to summon at once from the lobby. Will that work or will it be chaos? Parking lots are the most challenging domain, are they not? Lawsuits are coming Are they legally allowed to though? We've been beta testing this feature at work on lunch breaks. It behaves very cautiously to say the least. 

We love watching people react to a driver-less Model X! Would any other manufacturer have had the guts to flip the switch and turn this feature on? Concepts, mock drawings and cheap talk is one thing but having enough confidence in its technology to actually let drivers use it is another thing.  

The things Summon isn't programmed to do yet, put in bad light the amazing things it can do, like navigating around kerbs and parked cars, by making instant 3d maps of its immediate surroundings with cameras only, no lidar. This was thought by many to be impossible, yet Karpathy and team did it.

This is not the finished product but a very early version, the same way they figured kerbs they will figure the rest, like the path of moving cars, following lines and stay on correct side, etc. They must have thought most people would appreciate with a ""technical eye"" the amazing things Summon can do already, but people get hung on what it can't do and think it's clumsy and dangerous.

Unless Karpathy and team already solved the parts people complain about, and they're sending the updates in a few days, then it might be better to disable Summon for now. Then re-enable it when it's more developed.

Releasing it at this stage to the wide public, puts a great thing in a bad light. Oh I hope this goes well. All it will take is a few high profile accidents that dent a dozen or more cars and shit will hit the fan in the media. Please don't kill a baby, please don't kill a baby, please don't kill a baby, please don't kill a baby, please don't kill a baby, please don't kill a baby!

Parking lots are by far the deadliest places to be for children in vicinity of cars. Hopefully this can reduce that. And HOPEFULLY without any initial ""hickups""... I'm thinking the Natick Mall at Christmas. I wish I had a Tesla and I hope this works really well, but I'm glad I don't have to think about trying it with my car just yet.","Tesla just released a big software update that allows its cars to drive themselves in parking lots - ""Smart summon,"" which allows Tesla vehicles with the most robust version of the Autopilot driver-assistance system to drive in parking lots without anyone in the car.

Of course a robot will have perfect physics models, but the point is that these human drivers cause you to miss your left turn and wait another light cycle, and that's bad for traffic flow.   You actually need a vehicle that drives close to, but not over, the line of safety.   That takes its right of way when it is safe to do so.  A robot should be able to figure out those margins better than humans can.

Thank you in advance!",SelfDrivingCars,"I have some questions, and you seem knowledgeable.",17," I work in the field, and not to sound negative, but this is one area that has barely been explored. Most accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been settled out of court, meaning there are rarely, if any, court cases involving autonomous vehicle injury and death that go to trial. There are some related to Tesla, but that's a level two system which means the driver is still responsible for all vehicular functions and I doubt any judge or lawyer could prove Tesla is at fault or has negligence. 

> Any information about relevant legislation adopted by States or the Federal government of the US would be very helpful. 

Unfortunately, the federal government is lax in the US when it comes to self-driving cars. As of now, each state can write their own rules/laws concerning AV testing in their respective states. For example, California has one of the strictest laws in the country such as requiring drivers to possess an Autonomous Test Vehicle permit given by the DMV after passing internal tests, passing internal defensive driving courses, etc., whereas states like Michigan have none. Though the federal government can implement guidelines through the National Transportation and Highway Safety Administration (NTHSA), most states pick and choose what they feel will best help their economy regarding lax regulations to bring business into their states. I hope that helps, although I know your question was more related to insurance and liability. Everyone has their best guesses and thoughts, but I think we are too far from the endgame to understand the ramifications of how a post-autonomous cars world will look like in terms of insurance, liability, and responsibility. I'm not sure if any US federal laws have passed.  AV START stalled.  Politico has some good info about the failed bill (does your school have a subscription?).  If not, Google will be helpful.

There are some articles about companies thinking about how to handle insurance changes.  There might even be some venture-backed start-ups thinking about this problem.

As mentioned in  [Anonymicex](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anonymicex/)'s comment, there are some Tesla lawsuits ongoing.  This article describes one such lawsuit and links to a second lawsuit.

&#x200B;

There are several projects thinking about how an AV should behave in a crash scenario.  ""Moral Machine""   
 ([http://moralmachine.mit.edu/](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/)) is the most common.  You can also find many critiques of Moral Machine. You could look into accidents of driverless trains. These systems have been in operation for years. There aren't a lot of accidents, though - but legal questions could be similar. [Here's a link to a story about a recent accident in Japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/06/02/national/20-passengers-injured-automated-train-yokohama-travels-wrong-direction/). Perhaps you should consult one of the law librarians at your school. I work in the UK CAV space,

[UK Law Commision](https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/automated-vehicles/) Hello

Thank you for your post and asking . The liability point is one of the most important points when it comes to adoption of any innovation.

I will try to give some **personal opinions** from a technologist point of view.

We humans build **tools** (whether we call them autonomous or not, at [any level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car))  that are getting more and more sophisticated and, as tools, we are responsible for what we do with them. If misused (according to manufacturer's indications), liability falls on the party operating the system:

* Automated driving for personal usage (OEMs vehicles like Teslas): users are required to intervene to operate the system. For example, they need to engaged the automated feature. 
* Autonomous taxis, ride hailing etc. : user is not required to operate the system but service provider does operate it.

An example from aviation: Airliners are more than capable of taxing, taking off, flying and lading all in their own. But still companies did not remove pilots because: pilots are not a big cost in comparison with total profit of flight or the potential liability cost. Hence, we see pilots still in airplanes as a way to increase safety and have somebody to blame if autopilots fails. And [autopilots still fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings#Angle_of_attack_sensors_and_architecture).

A final ***opinion*** on [Levels of automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car#Classification): We humans devise levels of automation to make sense of the progress of automation effort, but in fact we have been always making progress and it is not possible to asses objectively at which level a system is. The progress to Level 5 Autonomous driving is not linear rather [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) (with time) and it is more likely to end up having a Level 4 system with less and less supervision as decades go.

I say this to make a reflection on automation. Consider the following case: We consider washing machines to be fully autonomous (Level 5) but still they sometimes fail and are misused.

Finally, I think that everybody would benefit if you could some of your conclusions. So, please share your paper here.

Players like Waymo and GM Cruise should avoid the temptation of using their vast amount of capital to engage in head-on competition with entrenched incumbents.

The problem with this, at least for Cruise, is that a lot of their promised investment money from Softbank is incumbent on them launching their ride-sharing service commercially.

The only reason they have any investment money is because the investors want to see the ride share service launched. If they tried to pivot, there would be a lot of pissed off investors and probably a few lawsuits.

The other thing the authors are missing is the fact that ride-hailing will likely be ""commoditized"" soon. Nobody's going to open up the Uber app and wait for an Uber. They'll open Google Maps, find their destination, and then select whichever ride service that Google Maps says is faster or cheaper or whatever the user is looking for. Nobody wants to have 5 different ride-hailing apps on their phone and try to figure out which one is best for the spot they happen to be in at any given moment. The issue is what happens when Waymo has the technology and Uber/Lyft don't.  Sure, they are the incumbents with the established brands in ride-hail.  But as they always say in the employee/contractor battle, they are not a ride service, they are an app, which provides services to drivers.   To the public, they are a brand.

So a new Waymo service is not the same business at all.  It's a real ride service, and not a service for drivers who play no part.    And, if Waymo decides to make use of the Google brand, from the world's top global brand.    This disruption is that it's a completely different product. If I had to bet on who would win here I'd probably split my bets evenly between Waymo, Cruise, Tesla, Uber, Lyft.

Although personally I think Uber/Lyft are like Nokia. They are far ahead now, but I think the tech barrier is too difficult for them to overcome. They are years behind in tech from Waymo/Cruise. I wouldn't bet on it, but I have a feeling they will not survive. The assumption that SDC applied on ride hailing is not a disruptive innovation, I think is too quickly said. Uber and Lyft offer nothing special but a car with a driver for point A to B.
So why a new player with a tech that offer the same service, cheaper and safer won't have a chance to beat them? >Because AVs are likely to be too expensive for personal ownership, there is broad consensus that deploying them within ride-hailing networks will be, at least initially, one of the most commercially viable paths for autonomous passenger transportation.

Even with the softening ""at least initially"" statements  this rings hollow to me. The premium for autonomous vehicles shouldn't be substantially more than the current high end cruise controls; and historically features like this drop in price.

I think the interest in ride-hailing networks mirrors the transition to recurring revenue  and ""as a service"" models we've seen all over the place but often in cloud computing. There are advantages to the provider because they get a constant revenue stream and there are advantages to the consumer because they don't need to deal with all the details. Like oil changes. 

I suspect the efficiencies shake loose a bunch of value for everybody involved. This is a win for society as a whole. Its not as efficient as good public transportation but it does help the last mile problem and also the social complication of some folks being ""too good to ride on the bus with those other people"" problems. Very interesting analysis of the strategic competitive landscape between companies like Uber, Lyft, Waymo, Cruise, Voyage, etc. Argues that Waymo and Cruise are unlikely to unseat Uber and Lyft as ride-hailing leaders and so should avoid a crazy expensive head-on battle. Stick to being technology providers, not ride-hailing networks. Is investing in autonomous vehicles now too late? How many Uber+Lift units are in use in a particular city? What are the logistics of replacing that number or a significant fraction in a given city? All our fun tech arguments aside, what any player is up against rolling out a ride share program at scale is just building, transporting, interim storage, of 5k? 20k? units. (times how many cities?)  Hardware rollouts are not like a software update, at volume units fail, tires get flat, need many trained support technicians.

That's such BS. Tesla's brand comes from customer satisfaction of a great car. Autopilot is not the central reason Tesla succeeded. I think the author here is being a little too gloomy, but maybe that story changes the first time there is an inattentive autopilot user that kills someone other than themselves. Every approach is dangerous as we don’t know what we don’t know.  Going slow can might be just going slow.  In machine learning it may mean that you collect less data.

There are those who think that they are the be all and end all future (me) 

And those who love to point out that it is all over every single time a self driving car crashes or does something stupid.

One group that doesn't tend to join the argument are people looking to go from A to B. 

One of the key elements that is missing from the typical user of taxis as applicable to driverless is that most people have a generally negative experience with the human driver. Either awkward small talk, the driver telling you he has 8 kids, hasn't had a fare in a month, and that he has to pay for his cab in blood all so he can get a tip, to drivers who are clinically insane (the bible says the yellow people will take over for satan). To just having to pay the extra human costs when in theory a robot cab will cost less. All the way out to other road users not having to put up with the a-hole driving that cabs typically exhibit.

Basically the driverless part of driverless cabs is going to be a massive feature; I would be willing to wait longer and pay the same to get a car without the encumbrance of a human, all other factors being the same (safety, etc). Once in a while I get a neat driver who is useful in some other way, but more often than not the driver is one of the less pleasant aspects of the ride.

BTW the real test of any of these services will be repeat customers. If people keep using it then it is working sufficiently well, if a bunch of people ""give it a try"" and don't come back then ... fail. How many passengers were allowed to record a video in the Waymo car? Is the number of disengagements reported?  Last I heard about Waymo service was issues with taking unprotected left turns and related issues with not being aggressive enough to get around efficiently.  Is that stuff getting any better? Is waymo winning this race? Every thing I read seems to indicate so. They seem to have the largest lead and also have been the most transparent about their progress.

Exciting times. I can't wait to see what actually happens. Doesn't mention how many unique riders. We know hundreds were in early rider, and over 1000 waymo one/early ride now in Phoenix.  So i am guessing its a several hundred in California - likely a lot of google employees. 

Its good news they are testing more in other areas but it not ready to really scale until they pull the safety drivers. What's the NDA situation on Waymo these days? Thousands of rides doesn't mean much when the people aren't allowed to speak about how well it actually performs. Waymo is theory and experimental. You cannot buy. No kit. No car. Rides in limited area are like a laboratory setting. Not practical and expensive.

Tesla is real. You can buy a car with hardware (chips, cameras, radars, ultrasonics) and software (ai models) and use it. It is incrementally getting better with over the air updates.

There is a very good answer. If it gets you there faster, use it. Remember if you have a working system I can replace a part of it and compare the output. So let's say my perception system depends on Lidar, if I run a second perception system and give the input to the predication and planning systems, I can see where the other parts of the system do different things. Then I can decide if the new system perceived something wrong, or did it surpass the other system. I can then focus on the delta's between systems, and improve the new system very quickly.

So imagine you have a fleet of L4 cars but they are so expensive they can't be run profitably. That is awesome, because you have data. That data can be used to make your system less expensive, and perform increasingly better. 

I would use more crutches if we have them. Like lifting the car so it rides higher up, and can avoid more obstacles on the road. Armoring the car so it has even better crash protection. Less safe driver plus more safe car could cancel out or even be positive. Data is key, data comes from miles driven, edge cases discovered. Is the Lidar price coming down? If you can't walk yet, use a crutch. Musk did say that when he worked on SpaceX he spearheaded the project to use LiDar. 

He went on to say that ""in SpaceX case it made sense but on cars it is freaking stupid"".

1 LiDar costs $7500 and a car needs 4, so total $30000. On top of that there are installation costs. Since it is a mechanical device, it needs constant maintenance. 

Contrast this with already installed 8 cameras (vision combined with AI). Musk seems to be right. LiDar is an expensive crutch that is unnecessary. Elon has not done a coast to coast driverless drive yet. 

So he should not be called correct. Here's my thing I think lidar has its place and both are possible.  Maybe not have top shelf lidar for the car but use it to help identify close threats for parking and such. This is simply another datapoint showing that Level 4 AV are not commercially realistic at the moment and won't be for a while. Can someone explain to me why the system designers for SDCs don't start out training the system to master multi-ocular depth perception first and foremost? Stick it in a dark room and turn on lights at different ranges or something so the system can learn depth perception and then build on that foundation. I mean, probably 70% of driving is knowing how far away things are and avoiding them. Using single camera monocular vision for that, which apparently is what EVERYBODY is doing, blows!

If you are interested in getting a car with advanced ADAS system, your are going to regret buying anything but a Tesla right now.  Maybe this will change in the future, but whatever you buy today from anyone other than Tesla will not be improved upon and in a year you'll have to get the new model, possibly from a different manufacturer.   The only reason to not get a Tesla is because of cost.  However, over the next 5 years, buying a Tesla is the cheapest way to stay on the bleeding edge of the industry.  I don't think Tesla will get FSD in the next 5 years but they have the best chance of getting close of any manufacture that will sell you a car.

Here are all the cars mentioned so far that I could confirm has something similar to Autopilot.  I tried to configure the cheapest spec car with ADAS support.  For example, BMW doesn't offer the package on the 2 Series which is cheaper than the 3 Series.  A lot of cars, the BMW specifically, are very difficult to find in the base spec so if you actually try to buy a car, it will probably be more than this for almost all these models.  These are all MSRP prices and not what you would actually pay for the car, with of course the Tesla being the exception.  This list is sorted by price.

* Cadillac CT6 (Base with Super Cruise) - $71,290
* BMW 330i Sedan (Base + Driving assistance Pro Package) - $44,050
* Tesla SR+ (Base + FSD) - $44,990 (Remove $1,875 Federal Credit + Your State Credit)
* Volvo XC40 (Base Momentum T4 FWD + Advanced Package) - $38,990
* Tesla SR+ (Base + Autopilot) - $38,990 (Remove $1,875 Federal Credit + Your State Credit)
* Kia Telluride (Base EX with Highway Driving Assist) - $37,090
* Hyundai Palisade (Base SE) - $31,550
* Nissan Altima (Base SV) - $27,880
* Hyundai Santa (Base FE) - $26,995
* Toyota Corolla (Base L + Comma AI Setup) - $20,600

**Edit:** Fixed Base Tesla Price
**Edit2:** Added Nissan Pro Pilot I don’t see it on this list so far, but the Pilot Assist in my Volvo is pretty darn good. As with anything, there’s room for improvement, but in everything I test drove, it was at the top of the list aside from Tesla. Smooth and it doesn’t stray outside the lane. 

Don’t get me started on the electronics in the car as a whole — it feels and acts like a Chinese knockoff of Mercedes — but the Pilot Assist is darn good. Checkout www.comma.ai [deleted] I don't know what the best is, but I drove a 2018 Vauxhall Astra as a hire car a while ago. It had lane hold, but it was next to useless. It would ping pong between lane lines and had a serious case of barrier lust. Not recommended. Nissan propilot 2.0

Apparently Kia Telluride ?

GM SuperCruise


In 2020 expect to see many more advanced ADAS systems launching from a variety of OEMs Current gen Audi A6 & A8 are supposed to have the highest level of automation from a German manufacturer. The a8 is supposed to be next to self driving. 

Mercedes and BMW hate not far behind. You have to configure the automation when ordering your car though. There is a wild forest of options available. 

Porsche has everything the others have, including a navigation linked, predictive speed assist. 

I don’t know if those features are all available in your market though. As far as adaptive cruise and lane keep go, I really enjoy my 2019 accord.  I have nothing to compare it to though.  It will keep me between the lanes and will come to a complete stop if the person in front of me does too.  Besides fully autonomous driving I'm not sure what more you would want. Volvo Here is a list of level 2 driverless cars:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane\_centering#Sample\_of\_level\_2\_automated\_cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_centering#Sample_of_level_2_automated_cars) I would like to know why distronic plus is not on top of the list, because it's best in e-class and it is expensive? My 2014 e-class is good enough in straight roads, but in right turns I don't trust it.
S-class got that covered with integration with maps. Nissan propilot 2.0 would be pretty similar to GMs supercruise and both of them would be slightly better than teslas autopilot (all are L2+ systems) since you have driver monitoring cameras (which have certain drawbacks but way better than tesla) and therefore you don't need to touch the steering wheel at all while ensuring you are actually paying attention to the road (the lack of which e.g. driver asleep at the wheel/people using some plastic device to mimic constant touch on the steering wheel etc. is causing most tesla fatalities while autopilot is engaged). The utilization of HD maps (both GM and Nissan use it) also ensures better robustness and a higher time duration provided to the driver to re-engage unlike Tesla which again has led to fatalities. No yet available, but tech leading the industry:

Waymo. Comma. Luminar. Zoox","Outside of Tesla, what car you can buy today has the best ADAS system? Autopilot and Cadillac's Super Cruise seem to be the undisputed class leaders, but what about systems from Toyota, Mercedes, Ford, etc? Is there one that stands out above the others?"

I recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride ""S"" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.

Coming from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the /u/thestraightpipes review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the ""best lane keep of any car they've driven this year"", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.

The two features I'm specifically interested in are the ""Lane Following Assist (LFA)"" and the ""Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)"". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.

THE SYSTEM IN USE

After enabling Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the ""Lane Following Assist"" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control. It even surprised me several times by being available on roads I would have never guessed it would work on. Roads that I know Autopilot would be available on, but anyone else's system, not so much (I'm looking at you Nissan Pro Pilot Assist).

Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" works best on perfectly straight, flat roads. This is the environment where confidence in the system is VERY high. It's when you get into one or both of the following circumstances that confidence in the system begins to erode; sharper curves, or shallower curves but at high speeds. At moderate highway speeds 55-65mph most shallow curves are handled well, but often the car would drift over the outer lane line. The system would stay engaged and not give up entirely, EVENTUALLY bringing me back slowly into the lane and near the center. The other circumstance is when road curve at higher speeds. In testing shallow curves at 75-80mph, the ""Lane Following Assist"" system would often give up entirely, turning the steering wheel icon from green to white without notice and I'd have to grip the wheel and turn myself back into the lane. 

In those circumstances the ""Lane Following Assist"" is more of a suggestion of help rather than the great confidence you get with Tesla's autopilot. With Autopilot you can really ""tune out"" and relax to a much greater degree. With the Kia system, it's helping to keep me steered in the center of the lane, but I really REALLY need to keep paying absolute attention. Yet, there were times I kept my hand gripped and at the ready when taking sharper curves on highway ramps and interchanges and the ""Lane Following Assist"" would slow down and turn into the sharper curves in a very surprisingly confident way. I just really never quite knew what to expect it to handle. Most likely after living with the Kia in daily driving for a while I'd start to really know how it works and what it's limitations are. The same happens to a lot of Autopilot users. At first they're frightened of letting go of the wheel. After using it for a year or two, you start to intimately understand it's limitations and strengths and trust it a lot more.

As far as knowing when the system is engaged and assisting with steering, it's a bit hard to tell. With Autopilot, is very obvious when jesus has taken the wheel. Two pulls on the stalk and you hear the ""bong boom"" chime. When the system turns off, you hear the ""boom bong"" chime. It's very obvious when you're engaging or disengaging the Autopilot system, and visually is very easy to see that it's active on the dashboard screen. With the Kia, the only way to know the steering is being assisted at all is when you feel a slight torque on the wheel while driving, and look down to see the steering wheel icon has turned from white to green. I was really never quite sure when it was active and going to help, or not help, without looking down at the dashboard and taking my eyes off the road. Perhaps the heads up display offered on the top Telluride SX trim with the Prestige package would help keep my eyes closer to the road.

Changing lanes is handled differently in each car. In the Tesla, with their self driving prowess, the cars with the enhanced autopilot or full self driving package handle the lane changes for you when the autopilot system is engaged. Turning on a signal, the car handles the lane change based on the cars around it. In the Kia, when you turn on the signal, the car relies on you to then steer the car out of your lane and into the other lane while the steering assist is temporarily paused. It resumes the ""Lane Following Assist"" a few seconds later once you're centered in the new lane.


BETTER OR WORSE?

Three areas where the Kia driving assist system actually performs BETTER than Tesla's Autopilot 2 are: the smoothness of the adaptive cruise control system, when lanes on the highway momentarily widen, and the length of time you can keep your hands off the wheel. 

The adaptive cruise, perhaps by the sluggish nature of the internal combustion engine drivetrain, would accelerate and brake so much more smoothly than any Tesla system I've ever used. It's just so much less twitchy, and far more smooth. It makes for a more relaxed experience in normal use. I didn't get a chance to experience how the Kia system would react to someone cutting in close at the last second, but hopefully that's handled well by the Kia. The only downside to Kia's adaptive cruise control system is one found in almost every other car aside from a Tesla. Once you come to a stop, after a very short amount of time, you have to re-engage the cruise control by tapping the accelerator pedal. In stop and go traffic having to constantly tap the gas pedal can become quite annoying compared to the Tesla, where it can go something like 5 whole minutes at a stop before it'll disengage. Stop and go traffic with Autopilot is more relaxing in this way.

Another area where the Kia system performed better than Tesla's Autopilot 2 is when lanes would momentarily widen, such as when driving in the far right lane going past an on ramp. In these locations, the road widens slightly and the Autopilot 2 system moves over to the right to remain in the middle of the wider lane, for each and everyone one of these you drive past. To anyone coming onto the on ramp it might appear you're trying to block them out. The Kia system performs much like how Tesla's Autopilot 1 system worked, which was a collaboration between Mobile Eye's camera+chip system, and Tesla's own software. In these circumstances the Kia and the Autopilot 1 system would keep the car steered straight, staying to the left of the momentarily widened lane. It's more like how a person would drive and far more natural. There were also a few moments in my experience with the Kia when the right lane line would be hard to make out or visually non existent, and the Kia system remained engaged confidently. There were also a few times when lane lines would be hard to make out at all on the freeway and the Kia system remained engaged like Autopilot would. Impressed!

The last area where the Kia system is better is, as pointed out in the Straight Pipes review, you can keep your hands off the steering wheel for a shockingly long amount of time in ideal conditions. Slow or stop-and-go traffic on long roads and highways is where Kia's system really shines, should you want to keep your hands off the wheel. Autopilot is very adamant about keeping your hand on the wheel, providing just a little bit of weight on one side or the other. It varies depending on your speed, but taking your hands off the Tesla steering wheel for more than around 10 seconds, the car would prompt you to put your hands back on. Nissan's Pro Pilot Assist is even worse in my experience. I didn't push the time limits of the Kia system, but it allowed for more hands off time that I personally would ever need, such as taking a two-handed sip of water from a water bottle, or grabbing a napkin from the glove box.

One thing I didn't get a chance to test was Kia's ""Highway Driving Assistant (HDA)"". It's found in the upper trim levels of the Telluride and from what I understand it uses the GPS/navigation system data just like Tesla's autopilot to know the speed limit of the road you're on and will adjust your cruise control speed to match the changes in speed limits. Though I like this feature in the Tesla, I've also found it to be limiting on some country back roads and farm roads where you want to be driving maybe a little over the speed limit to keep with the flow of traffic and not be holding anyone back. Autopilot will only ever let you go 5mph over the limit of the road you're on and sometimes that's annoying on those kinds of roads. Flat, wide open, no pedestrians around, and most people driving in front and behind driving 10mph over the limit. Perfect conditions for autopilot to keep the monotony of that road at bay, yet I won't use it because it limits my speed more than I'd like.

Another condition I didn't get to experience in the Kia was stopped car detection. In Tesla's case, a few high profile incidents have occurred involving semi trucks or fire trucks stopped on the highway and the car did not detect the stationary object. This is something that ALL cars from ALL manufacturers with radar+camera systems struggle with. You're approaching at high speed and the car in front of you suddenly moves over and you're faced with a stopped vehicle or object. Does the car react in time? The Tesla does an ok job MOST of the time.


IN CONCLUSION

The key feeling I get here with the Kia system, and even some of my experiences with Nissan's Pro Pilot, is inconsistency. I can never quite tell, at least in my short 24 hours with the Kia system, when it's going to give up on me or when it's going to push through and really provide steering assist I can rely on. Tesla's autopilot is still the gold standard in reducing the stress load on the driver on the highway, really providing a strong sense of confidence and predictability that most other systems are still lacking. I haven't tried BMW's new system found in their updated 3 series and X5, but this is the closest anyone's gotten to Autopilot and it works well enough that should I ever want the very excellent Kia Telluride or Hyundai Palisade, I'd feel VERY at home in Los Angeles traffic with their system. Great work Kia.",SelfDrivingCars,Is Kia Telluride's driving assist system as good as Tesla's Autopilot? It's actually pretty close. Here’s an in depth review from a Tesla owner.,136," Been waiting for someone to do a comparison between these two after hearing that claim on straight pipes.

A major difference can be explained that in the Kia you can steer with the LFA assist on. While with the Tesla it’s either driving or you’re driving, you can’t steer on top of Autopilot without disabling the system. 

Try to do some research on Ford Copilot 360 Assist+, Toyota Lane Tracing, KIA LFA, Honda Sensing, Volvo Propilot etc... There’s very little reviews or literature on how these systems work. Most that I’ve test driven are not very clear about when they are actively steering for you. Ford’s lane centering will make a “bong” noise only some of the time in my car when lane centering disables.

Manufacturers are being very hesitant to advertise or embrace the technology they’ve created, but it’s arguably the most important factor in cars. I hope they can figure out the potential liability for these systems and start advertising them more and competing based on this, as I believe competition and incentives to improve this tech is the only way we’ll progress towards legislation that allows level 3 and beyond vehicles to exist and for people to become comfortable with it. Great write up; thank you for this. Sounds remarkably like what I would have written to describe the GLC300, even down to that white/green steering wheel icon being the only identifier. Was there some collaboration between Kia and MB?

What’s your background? Are you in the auto industry in some capacity? >The last area where the Kia system is better is, as pointed out in the Straight Pipes review, you can keep your hands off the steering wheel for a shockingly long amount of time in ideal conditions. Slow or stop-and-go traffic on long roads and highways is where Kia's system really shines, should you want to keep your hands off the wheel.

So we consider this a plus now? I thought the fact that tesla allows you to take the hands off the wheel at all was a bad feature of AP according to realtesla.. I have driven 3000 miles on Kia's system, right after comparing it with a Tesla and I completely agree with your conclusions. I also quite liked Kia letting me set the speed limit to whatever I want, and not just 5mph over lol. It made long drives a LOT more bearable. Very interesting review, thanks for writing about this in a level of detail I haven’t seen before. Can you believe writing all this quality info and not even getting a few upvotes...your doing gods work. Loved the read and detail. This is awesome. These are things that put everything in perspective. I don’t know how far along Tesla is in terms of full self driving but how wrong am I in saying that these other car companies are closer to Tesla than Tesla is to Google’s tech. I was excited to read your post because of the title. Having Autopilot-like driving assistance from a more established automaker might give some more peace of mind. It’s my favorite part of my Tesla (apart from it being electric). However, this Kia solution sounds like a slightly improved version of what many cars have had for around a decade. My AP1 Model S very very rarely crosses a lane line. 
Not sure how you came to the conclusion in your title after reading the part about how it can’t take many curves without drifting over the line... Great review 👍. Thank you.

But just remember that current Tesla AP version is 2.5 or Enhanced Autopilot which includes NoA and other safety features. 

Glad to see that Kia's driving assistant is good but again, remember that you are comparing Kia's 2019 tech VS Tesla 2016 tech. Thank you for this awesome write up! Great info! I've been curious as well after the Straight Pipes review. Lane Centering/Adaptive Cruse Control are the top features I am looking for on a new car right now. I've tested Tesla, Volvo, and Toyota (New RAV4/Corolla) so far and was very interested to see Kia/Hyundai's take. As well as Subaru's new system. Most of the auto reviewers seem to just brush over this stuff and not go into any demonstrations or details.

So far from my personal experience I've preferred Volvo's system. But as you mentioned none of these systems warn you well enough when the lane centering has disengaged as well as Tesla.

I did 6 hours of highway driving with the Tesla model 3 and that random ""Phantom breaking"" scared the shit out of me though. It almost caused an accident multiple times with people behind me. Same with auto lane change on Mad Max mode. I had to turn it off. I never had that experience with the Volvo. Background: The Kia Telluride Highway Driving Assist system probably comes from the partnership of Hyundai/Kia with Aurora, right?  Chris Urmson (CMU entry in DARPA Grand Challenge) and Sterling Anderson (former Tesla employee) are developers at Aurora.  I don't yet know what compute hardware and software architecture is involved, do you?  Is a neural network involved in HDA?  Thanks for all info, this is a nice development.  Related:

We are in a meta-trolley problem: Do nothing, and 1,000,000 people die annually from car accidents (35,000 per year in the US, 3,200 in Germany, etc). Replace most human drivers with robots, and 90% of those people die, but a tiny tiny tiny faction of those are ""the wrong"" people.

Let's stop the bullshit. As soon as self-driving cars are provably safer than human drivers, it is a moral imperative to install them as widely as possible. Anything else is just stupid. That has been posted here before, and we have also discussed way too much, of how this problem is a fake one. The question is not ""Whom should we kill?"" butt ""How can we avoid killing anyone?""

Here is more: [https://thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2017/02/20/the-ethical-problem-of-the-ethical-dilemma-with-driverless-cars/](https://thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2017/02/20/the-ethical-problem-of-the-ethical-dilemma-with-driverless-cars/) **This topic is irrelevant.**

**ALL** moral “dilemma” problems are automatically solved and a non issue. “How?” you may ask?

Well let me ask you this. Will you ever buy a car that prioritizes other people’s lives over you (and your family) in an event of a potential car crash?

See, done. All self driving moral dilemmas solved. No one will be willing to buy a car that prioritizes other people’s safety over their own. Our own selfishness will force car manufacturers to sell cars that prioritizes the driver’s safety. There was a lecture or keynote speech by a guy who said the trolly situation has basically never happened in the last 250 years. 

Anybody got a link to the video? I liked the [comma.ai](https://comma.ai) guy's solution. Defer driving to the human behind the wheel when it's a trolley problem. Sounds ridiculous, but absurdly simple. A self-driving car will not face such a problem to begin with unless some genius decides to jump in front of the car at the last minute, in which case, even a human couldn't do anything differently. The question is: what would a human do? Based on that answer, you would program your algorithm to do the right thing. If a human's decision is wrong, then you rework on behavior prediction and path planning to make it correct. Some of this is a silly choice.  It assumes the car can tell the difference between 4 people and 3 people and a dog. It won't.  What is clear to me is that the car should default to straight.  Slamming on the brakes and turning will often put the car into a skid and wipe out both sets of subjects! Thats easy. Kill the cats. In other news today, a self driving vehicle smashed into a brick wall going 50 mph when it mistook a group of plastic bags as a woman in a dress crossing at a crosswalk the do least harm algorithm immediately swerved to avoid surely killing the plastic bags and instead the passengers in the vehicle are in critical condition at a nearby hospital.

That's of course if you could program such explicit choices into the machine and know why it made the choices it did.",What should a self driving car do?

I think that future prototypes would be better camouflaged with that sort of paint because you can’t make up any edge at all, whereas a good video of even the best camo can be reverse engineered.

It's certainly not the safety nightmare that Waymo envisioned that caused them to pivot in 2013.

Would Waymo be further along with 6 years of a commercial highway project? Perhaps long haul trucking would be scaling by now?

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear your thoughts.",SelfDrivingCars,"With hindsight, was Waymo wrong to scrub on ramp to off ramp ""autopilot"" in 2013?",58," Really good question. In hindsight it seems like they should have added robust driver monitoring and rolled it out circa 2013-14. Imagine the quality of the highway driving today if they had done that, probably saving non-negligible amounts of lives, gas, and money along the way. They also could've continued to develop or build out full self-driving at the same time, while learning a lot from their highway miles.

 🤷 >Would Waymo be further along with 6 years of a commercial highway project?

If they deployed a commercial highway pilot, I don't see how that would expedite their urban L4 autonomy much.

>Would the industry be further along?

I am not sure what you are getting at.
One thing, I suppose if Waymo partnered with one OEM and offered a really really good consumer highway pilot.  (better than any that are out there now)... Would this have pushed other OEMs to develop competing systems more?  I'm not sure, that it would have.

>Would there have actually been less accidents on the road?

Well, atleast the vehicles with the Waymo hihgway pilot would have fewer accidents yet I think Google/Waymo made the correct  business decision to skip autopilot and focus on urban L4 driving for sure.

That said, I don’t see anything wrong with highway pilot, driver assist systems.  They reduce accidents and save lives. 

I think now all major OEMs have a basic L2 systems now, and these systems all increase highway safety.  And almost all OEMs will be launching in the near future more advanced L2 systems that allow hands free driving and many other features, these systems also increase highway safety.

Although, I am frustrated with ADAS... because it miseducated and misleads the public about self driving cars.  ADAS is and will continue to educate consumers about the limitations of ADAS.  However, most consumers do not realize how different ADAS and SDCs are. And furthermore limitations of ADAS make media headlines and hysteria which also hurts SDC industry.  So it’s very frustrating.... though... currently ADAS reduces more accidents and saves way more lives than SDCs do... and it will probably continue to be this way for the next several years and maybe even 10 years. The truth is, a highway autopilot is boring.  It might save some lives, so that's not boring, but it's not the brass ring, and the brass ring is what Google always goes for.

This product would be something to give time back to rich people, by letting them sleep/work/relax in the highway portion of their trips, in a car that costs $10,000 or so more than the standard car.   A decent product, but not the kind Google does.  It only makes a small number of billions. Probably not. If they were ready in 2013, they would still need to develop the driver monitoring software. Then they would have had a long road to value engineering the hardware. I can't imagine them releasing a  product until at least 3 years later or 2016. Probably later than that, because OEM manufacturing and procurement process is by necessity long. 

Remember Super Cruise and Pro-pilot are using the EyeQ 3 hardware (Camera only) first finished in 2014. There are no cars yet using their current EyeQ4 chips, developed in 2018, and the EyeQ5 isn't out yet. 

So I don't think being a mobile eye competitor would have been a good move. I don't think so.  If you are targeting L4, highway driving is a late stage optimization.  You don't need it, it is comparatively easy and it is intrinsically dangerous.  On the other hand, street driving is essential, hard and comparatively safe.

The road data can come from human driven vehicles so the Streetview fleet, for example, provides a geographically broad dataset (close to 100% coverage).  On the other hand, it is probably very thin in other dimensions.  I think that Google relies heavily on simulation which is not great as assumptions in the simulation can taint the outcome. The main point was that Level 2 systems make humans complacent. It doesn't matter how many lives Tesla's tech has saved. The goal is to reduce those deaths, not add to it. Waymo had the foresight to realize ADAS is not the way to go. OEMs can likely very easily replicate lvl 2 systems like Tesla, BUT, they don't want to because OEMs have more to lose than Tesla currently. >Fast forward 6 years and Waymo is only doing a handful of miles truly driverless.

Just wondering, since I've read this in another thread as well - what is the source for this?  Last time I read something about Waymo, they talked about needing the safety driver mostly for parking lots and ""stopping at the right location"" for the customer. > The impact on lives saved and safety from Waymo isn't much. The income from the company is certainly small compared to their potential.

Did you ever come across the term ""moonshot project""? Google internally called the SDC project a ""moonshot project"" because it resembles some of the unique conditions and dangers NASA had to deal with back in the days of Apollo. Gene Krantz, flight director of the Apollo missions,  put it together in one sentence: ""Failure is not an option."" It takes time to do it right, but if they suceed, the impact on lives saved (and many many other aspects of daily life that interfere with traffic) will change dramatically. (and perhaps cash flow, too ;-). My model3 does off ramps with great ease. The on ramps are the problem for me in autopilot. They were wrong plain and simple and i called this years ago. Google is bad at bring first with innovative consumer products. Supercruise proved in 2016 that driver monitoring camera basically solves the un-attentive issues. The exact same issues Google mentioned. For a tech company they are so short-sighted. [deleted] Tesla has way more cars on the road with Autopilot than Nissan and Cadillac. Hard to know if the eyes thing is the problem or just the probabilty. While I don't have any special insight, I kind of get the feeling that Waymo's strategy is to sit on their tech and improve it until there is a competitor ready to enter the market, then stomp them with it.","With hindsight, was Waymo wrong to scrub on ramp to off ramp ""autopilot"" in 2013?

That one takeover was gnarly. The more I see about openpilot the more excited I am, even with e 0.x.x release they’re doing amazing things.

Has anyone compared openpilot to Tesla’s autopilot in feature terms? I don't like this argument that there are ""no lane markings at all"". That is a DANGEROUS and FALSE argument. It's not true that there are no lane markers. It can see both sides of the road and gauge from there. Note also that the driver had to take over for the dogs as well which constitutes yet another thing the cameras can see but didn't full compensate for.

Whether the driver's actions were empirically necessary or merely due to a sense of moral superiority is irrelevant, he felt compelled to so. And I would argue that, because of that, this system isn't good enough yet to take over for a windswept winter conditions such as I've experienced many times on rural forested roads where all sense of lane markings disappear entirely.

The computer still has the advantage of GPS which of course my brain does not. So I'd be very curious to see what the computer's brain decides to do in that case. I my case, as a human being, I would maintain whatever line I believe I was following and slow down until stopped. But what would the computer do? Would it keep driving along its GPS path thinking that it's accurate enough? This of course depends on whoever is programming it.

These are complex problems to solve.

I would just urge you not to avoid telling us that there are no markings. There *are* markings! Cameras are VISUAL. Visual cues are PROCESSED. Processed cues are RESPONDED TO. Responses have CONSEQUENCES (good or bad). You fool no one by saying there are no makings.

the last breaking article title I heard was like two years ago that’s quick af (relative to everyone else in the same tech field) keep up the hard work and actual funding Tesla.
 “actual funding” because other companies say they are funding R&D but don’t result in much D or funding
Cough cough *other car companies* cough cough new battery tech that actually has a chance to leave the lab is always good. looks like pretty mature testing stage. 

I somewhat disagree that the depth of discharge for SDC is going to be 100%. you will need roughly twice the vehicles at peak time than you do off-peak, so you're going to have a lot of vehicles sitting idle anyway, you may as well take them out of circulation before they're totally discharged you only need all of your vehicles in service for about an hour, then you can cycle them out.. This is good to hear, and Dahn knows the difference between a lab prototype and a tested cell, but there is still a difference between a tested cell and a mass produced cell.   Only when you mass produce will you learn what cost you can do it at, and how reliable they are after production.  However, if they can pull that off it will be good. The batteries are one of the few parts that ""more is always better"" on.   In that if the battery lasts a million miles, but the car only lasts half a million, you can move the battery to the next car.

The robotaxi problem has several factors.  Almost all vehicles are down at night and power is cheapest at night. You want a taxi to be able to last a day to take advantage of that.  However, you can take a portion of your taxis down from 10am to 11:30 and 1:30 to 3 for some partial recharging -- at daytime rates.   

In the future, with massive solar installs, those daytime rates might be much more interesting.

Having a full day pack uses more room and weight than a half-day pack, but the cost seems to be less than I initially thought, so full day packs will rule. This would be great for Powerwalls and manned cars too.

So the battery is not specific to driverless cars. This article keeps re charging like the battery.

Oh the humanity Why not capture the water and make the system reversible to use electricity to turn the water back into hydrogen and oxygen? Essentially a hydrogen oxygen water battery. My thought is that the oil companies want to be in the fuel supply chain. They are not in the electricity supply chain so they wish to make a new hydrogen supply chain that they can be in the middle of.  That is how they can get their money. 

Good luck to them. 

Start doing it instead of making videos. Roll out the cars and the hydrogen supply chain so that vehicle owners can drive anywhere like we do with EVs. 

In the end EVs are more efficient and the reliability has been proven. The reliability is now on the way to million mile life on the drive trains for EVs.

very small lenses Building a working fusion reactor might be an easier project.... A “Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser” by itself does nothing for you. This is just a single element of some LiDAR assemblies. You need a complete opto-electrical system to do any type of time of flight transmission, and to do macro-mechanical scanning, you need a rotational stage.


The article describes the method they use to “steer” the laser beams. Hard to tell if it’s really micro lenses or micro mirrors, but the same concept applies. An electrically-driven MEMS optical device points laser beams to broaden the Field of View of just the individual lasers.


If you’re asking these kind of questions, you’d really need far more optical experience to build anything resembling a LiDAR system. Do you know how VCSELs actually generate light? Extremely short (5-10ns) High current (3A+) pulses. You’ll need a specific IC Driver for that. How about how it calculates ToF? Well, that depends on the architecture. Have you looked at the VL53L1X? It's an integrated sensor with a VCSEL, receiver, optics, and timing circuitry, really easy to use.  Not sure what your goal is for the project, but if you don't need as much range that would be very doable VCSEL is a type of laser like macaroni is a type of pasta.  

And if you’re wondering how off-the-shelf Barilla pasta product could be heated and/or incorporated into your hypothetically novel carbohydrate edible serving such as by boiling or simmering, one thing certain is that you’re not going to be a prominent Italian chef by 9AM tomorrow.

https://youtu.be/iwcYp-XT7UI Did you guys also read the similar article:

""Why flying cars have failed to take hold""

Riveting stuff In my opinion, and it's just an opinion, the biggest issue will probably be that OEMs won't want to assume any liability in the event of a crash.  Accidents are inevitable, even if the L3 vehicle is not ""at fault.""  Once an OEM says their car is L3, they assume huge liability risks that they're not compensated for.  Why would they take on that risk?  So even if the technology becomes ""safe"" (at least as good as a human) to build, the OEMs will still call it L2/L2+ and tell drivers to keep watching the road and they're still liable for anything that happens.

Tesla is taking pretty big liability risks with their Autopilot.  This could come back to haunt them if NHTSA says it's too risky and/or a jury decides in favor of accident victims and Tesla is hit with hundreds of millions of dollars in jury awards.  Not sure the market is reflecting this risk. I’ve been saying this for almost two years. We are going to skip Level 3 for the most part. It will be a brief evolutionary step in the technology, but will soon be made illegal as the cost to life and property exceeds acceptable levels.",Why Level 3 automated technology has failed to take hold

Seriously though. An interesting strategy from TomTom. HD maps will definitely be useful and figuring out how to create them and keep them updated often enough will be quite the business going forward.

How well this is done will tell us how much an SDC can rely on maps to help with the DDT. (or how little it can rely on them vs real time sensing) The biggest news here is that TomTom still exists. Who knew? I'm concerned that TomTom won't be very good at mapping.  Historically they purchase their maps and they were just the last mile for distributing the data.  They will be bootstrapping into this role and from what I've seen of them during map acquisition negations with them, I don't see it working out.

It's pretty powerful for no more than it is (what, less than $1k?), but I think it's extremely premature to be calling out SDC startups for something that is limited to lane keeping and advanced cruise control.  That's what it is (right now).  No lane changes - just camping in the middle lane. I posted this a while ago in the context of Quanergy, but it’s also definitely applicable here (I originally read it as a Quora comment):

>You see, back then, this guy, Joseph Sugarman adopted a marketing tactic[2] that goes like this:

>Suppose that everyone believes Nikon is the best camera that a consumer or a low level pro can buy. Nikon has spent hundreds of millions in research and development to get their cameras where they are. They spend a lot of promotional money (big money) to keep that brand recognizable.

>So someone like Sugarman comes along and says, how can I make money off Nikon? So he finds a competent Japanese company that can make an excellent camera, but without a well known name. He checks it out. It is pretty good. Maybe not quite Nikon, but a good value. So he puts some new name on the product, and then he takes out full page ads that read something like this:

>JS&A XD7500 camera offers Nikon $5 million if Nikon D7500 can beat the JS&A XD7500 in a fair contest

>The ad features a picture of the camera, and a picture of the $5 million check. It also spells out that there will be a variety of models and scenery that represent normal photographic and lighting conditions. It will also suggest a panel of judges from photographic societies and magazines.

>This game has been played again and again with audiophile equipment, radar detectors, fast cars, tires, you name it. The number of times that the big name has taken the bait is exactly zero.

>Here’s what happens. The challenge is never answered. The knock-off product gets a big jump in sales because it looks like the big name is afraid of the challenger.

>Here’s why no one takes the challenge: Even being in the same contest with the challenger gives some credibility to the challenger. Even if the big name accepted the challenge, JS&A only loses a check but still gets publicity for it. If by some chance the big name took the challenge, what would happen? The scoring has been set up so that scores will be close. The big product gets a score of 95 and the challenger gets a score of 91. At that point a lot of people will say: “I don’t have $2000 for the Nikon, but at $800, the JS&A is almost as good.” The challenger still does not lose. But JS&A never expects to have to pay out on the check. The big name is not ever going to take the challenge. I can't imagine this being a tough challenge, especially since it's just highway driving on a perfect day and perfect road. Based on the 3 comments before mine, I think people are missing the point of this post.

The point is that _every_ company should be better than OP. Since everything OP does is free and MIT licensed, it sets a minimum bar for all companies and is constantly raising it. 

If at any point you are unable to beat OpenPilot, you don't deserve to exist. Just Comma.ai being agro again. I don't like it when people pick on people/companies that aren't doing as well as them to try to make themselves look better. Comma.ai very well knows that there are many companies above them that could show better results than they showed in this video. I don't get what there point is. There are companies above them and below them, and we all knew it. Just seems like agro PR to me.

That being said, they are a neat company, and i do look forward to seeing how far they can get. This would be fairly trivial for Tesla right? If you stick an orange in the steering wheel.. Sounds easy. Lane-Keeping Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control are relatively easy to achieve.

lidar wipers are not unique to ford/argo, of course; waymo has a [similar cleaning system](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/6biyr8/waymo_wipers_on_the_lidar_sensor/), (although is unclear how fast it works; the clip they released is edited down to remove passes), and uber atg [even patented one](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180015907A1/en). > Fully integrated into the tiara, our cleaning system features **next generation nozzles** next to each camera lens that can spray washer fluid as needed to clean the sensors. 

I chuckled a bit even though this description might be true. The last GIF in the article shows a terrible design.

The water does not even reach the top of the glass - the nozzle should be at the top of the glass rather than the bottom of the glass. >Here’s how it works: As the car is driving, the tiara funnels air out through different slots near the camera lens. This creates an “air curtain” that actually deflects bugs away from the sensor itself. So anytime bugs are making a bee-line for a camera lens, the air flowing out of the tiara pushes it aside so it doesn’t make contact with the lens.

This is actually a great solution.

It is the accolade for Waymo boss John Krafcik. On September 12, he will open the IAA in Frankfurt together with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Although the fair may have lost its shine, it is still the most important industry gathering in the world.

With Krafcik and the Google spin-off Waymo as the opening partner of the IAA on the side of the Chancellor, the Silicon Valley is finally in the limelight of the auto industry.

It is well known to the board in Wolfsburg, Munich and Stuttgart Waymo: No other company has so much experience with self-driving cars. Ten million miles on US roads and more than ten billion digital miles in gigantic cloud simulations are on the clock. No other competitor can match that.

Silicon Valley attacks are not new to the auto industry. Apple fled in the attempt to enter the car business back, so the electric pioneer Tesla has already taken the German industry considerable market share in electric cars.

Waymo, founded in 2009 and spun off online giant Google in 2016, has a new quality. Waymo does not want to build cars, but targets the intelligence of the self-driving car. Analogous to the mobile phone, the company wants to control the future operating system of the traffic.

It's a long-planned coup. Silent giant Waymo has what it takes to create the crucial breakthrough for Alphabet Holding to build the much-needed second leg alongside Google's online advertising. In what is currently the largest growth area of ​​IT, cloud computing, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has so far not been able to catch up decisively, with Amazon and Microsoft taking over. Google is doing well, but still struggling with IBM, Alibaba and Oracle for the falling crumbs of the long-distributed cake.

Unlike Waymo: the technological leadership of the Alphabet subsidiary in the market for autonomous driving is indisputable, although Tesla boss Elon Musk vociferously doubts this fact. Musk, who is in direct competition with Waymo, and wants to build up its own fleet of Tesla robotics worldwide at record speed, declared autonomous vehicles with ""Lidar"" technology to be doomed.

Waymo not only works with Lidar modules mounted like a cathedral on car roofs, but also develops its own Lidar modules, which are getting smaller and cheaper. Lidar draws three-dimensional, digital imagery of the environment, giving depth to the images, which can convert car computers to distances and speeds in fractions of a second. Tesla believes that these calculations can only be done with cameras and radar.
Waymo follows different business models

Waymo is considered a leader in lidar technology. The significance of the long neglected system became clear in February 2018, when Waymo sued the Uber vehicle service for patent infringement and theft of intellectual property. A top manager changed from Waymo to Uber is said to have copied and taken data on a large scale.

The process, which had been fueled by the entire technology industry, was then surprisingly blown out of court in just a few days out of court against the payment of $ 245 million in Uber stock ""and an apology"" to Waymo-Mother Alphabet. Both parties apparently feared that too much dirty laundry could be washed and trade secrets betrayed in a public trial.

Waymo's progress is being closely monitored in the German auto industry. Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess gives the Americans a lead of ""one to two years"" in autonomous driving, ""but the game is not lost yet"". It was not until the middle of July that Diess teamed up with rival Ford and joined his daughter Argo, who works intensively on the robot car.

BMW development chief Klaus Fröhlich holds the development of autonomous driving for a ""Mars mission"", which, however, no manufacturer will create before 2021. Then BMW wants to build its ""inext"" in series. The electric SUV should be able to drive autonomously, at least on motorways. For the further stages, BMW has allied in the spring with the arch rival Daimler.

In fact, the euphoria surrounding the robot car has slowed significantly in German industry in recent months. Thus, the cooperation of Daimler and BMW aims at ""automated"" and no longer ""autonomous driving"". The driver should therefore not be abolished for now, but only to be relieved as much as possible.

In Munich and Stuttgart, the technology is considered so costly and expensive that it is not worthwhile for private customers in the foreseeable future. In addition, Europe lacks the legal framework that makes it possible to operate robotic cars in densely populated cities.

In Silicon Valley you can see it differently, here you continue on the big breakthrough. The calculus: Seventy percent of the costs in the business with taxis and car hire go to the driver. Whoever replaces the driver dominates the mobility of the future. Entirely conceivable would be entire cities, in which only robotic cars drive and thus immediately replace public transport and today's logistics systems.

Such visions are also reflected in studies of large investment houses. In December, Jefferies updated its previous valuation of Waymo from 75 to 125 billion dollars to 250 billion dollars. That would be about as much as GM, Uber and Lyft are worth together on the stock market today.

The reason, according to Jeffries, ""Waymo pursues various business models. Our current assessment, ""it said in December 2018,"" includes not only autonomous technology, but also transportation services - people, goods, food - technical support for third parties, in-car services such as advertising, marketing, entertainment or business. Offers and completely new types of vehicles. ""However, Jeffries admits that, above all, the timing of the introduction of the technology is still extremely uncertain.

Previously, Morgan Stanley had raised his estimate for Waymo from $ 75 billion to $ 175 billion. The uncertainties of the time horizon and the completely unexplored markets are a bet on the future. UBS, for example, gives a valuation window of $ 25-135 billion for Waymo. However, the Swiss also estimate that sales from Waymo taxi services alone could amount to around $ 114 billion by 2030.

The clou: Google, as well as Amazon's cloud subsidiary AWS or Microsoft, along with their cloud computing daughters and their global data networks and storage centers, could earn on the data boom that the autonomous cars are likely to trigger. The chip manufacturer Intel assumes that only a single self-driving car in 90 minutes drive, will produce about 4 terabytes of data. That would be comparable to the data production of 3000 web users within 24 hours.
Rapid expansion requires more capital investment

A business in which the Chinese giants Alibaba and Baidu also want to earn. Intel, too, has invested heavily in real-time chip-making and data-processing expertise. Alone the purchase of the Israeli provider Mobileye, formerly Tesla partner, Intel cost in 2017 proudly 15.3 billion dollars.

A partnership that should also benefit the German automotive industry. Intel and Mobileye are also partners of BMW in the development of the ""inext"".

Waymo continues his own pace. In December 2018, the launch of the first commercial taxi service with self-driving cars, the Google sister used Vans of the US manufacturer Chrysler. A security driver is still sitting behind the wheel, driven in four suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona.

There, the technology has been in the test since 2016. Waymo is allowed to earn money with the vehicles, which sets the alphabet daughter light years ahead of the competition. Neither Cruise Automation of General Motors nor the car broker Uber or Tesla have been able to overcome this hurdle.

Driving with Waymos Chrysler Pacifica big taxis cost the safety driver exactly as much as normal rides today with the competition. If this back-up driver falls away, the price advantage would be enormous. Since July 2019 Waymo also has a license for Robotaxis with safety drivers in California. However, no fare may be required by the test customers.

How much the Waymo mother Alphabet has invested in her still-deficient adventure is a closely guarded secret. But industry observers estimate the sum at so far well over a billion dollars. Alphabet could certainly continue to support Waymo alone, after all, the company is now richer than Apple, but investors look with eagle eyes on the earnings of the Group. An investment offensive in a state-wide robotaxidienst could also notice Alphabet in the coffers.

According to ""The Information"" Waymo could now take the first time capital from external investors to accelerate its rapid expansion. So far, such speculations are not commented on, but recent progress could accelerate the process with correspondingly high company valuations. After the IAA would certainly not be a bad time for such an announcement. Waymo will be opening the Frankfurt International Autoshow next week together with German chancellor Angela Merkel. I wonder if it was Angela Merkel's choice to go with John Krafcik as tit for tat because of Dieselgate ;-) So a German auto partnership?",IAA [in German]: New Attack From Silicon Valley: The Silent Giant Waymo Enters The IAA

That said, if the Autopilot source code had as many typos in it as this report, there'd be a hundred deaths a year. NTSB really needs a proof-reader.

By using semiautonomous tech we are training humans to be complacent with features and comforts that don't exist. Once again it says, ""the driver did not have his hands on the wheel"" when all that is actually known is that he didn't apply torque force to the wheel.   It is possible to have your hands well on the wheel and get the ""no torque detected"" warning from the Tesla -- in fact it is quite common.

This paper should have been titled. ""SWAG at SDC Economics"" Ok, I have finished reading the paper.  Overall this is a high quality paper with well a lot of enlightening data and sources.  I particularly appreciated these facts:

* Average age of a car in the US is [13-17 years](https://berla.co/average-us-vehicle-lifespan/).
* San Francisco has a max allowed mileage of [425k for taxis](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/police/policecode?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:sanfrancisco_ca$sync=1).
* Cab fare in San Francisco is averages to $3.55/mile excluding any traffic waiting charges.
* Cabs operate about 90k miles per year
* Profit per cab to the fleet operator is $24k/year
* Cabs have a 50% utilization rate per mile driven

The paper takes all the costs for existing cabs including medallion costs, insurance, car costs, etc, and then replaces the driver cost with a remote monitoring operator cost.  The difference is that the remote operator can cover between 5 and 50 vehicles at a time.  This puts the per mile cost of an SDC at between $1.60 and $6.00 per mile depending on how many vehicles the operator can cover.  Issues I have with the paper are:

* They didn't at least acknowledge scale of operations having 2nd and 3rd order effects.  To some degree they allowed that SDCs could achieve greater utilization without acknowledging the source would be scale of operations.  The also carries on to other costs which I'll point out in various items below.  Taxis are limited by the ability of the fleets to attract a workforce at a given price point.  With this gone the fleets can deploy more units profitably and gain levels of scale that can't be achieved otherwise.
* Vehicle cost of $15k is way too low and to their credit, the authors acknowledge this.  It isn't clear where this number came from as they specifically say the vehicle is a hybrid and gets 48mpg.  The cost would be 2x or more in reality.  In the end I think the cost is small even when it's 2x or 3x that cost so they stuck to their cost source and moved on.
* They included medallion costs and they were significant.  The medallion alone is $0.11/mile.  Cities aren't going to charge every SDC $250k for a medallion if they want to fix their transportation problems.  Today taxis are seen a luxury items that can be taxed without worry but when you start taxing basic transportation it becomes incredibly regressive and you will see these taxes backed off on.  For a private car, the tax is a fraction of a penny per mile for comparison.
* They had insurance at almost 5x the typical cost for private.  While commercial insurance is higher, at scale fleets will self insure and massively reduce costs.  This isn't a small amount of costs as it was $0.11/mile .
* They had the maintenance priced based on a hybrid drive train and was 4x more than it will be in EV fleet cars at scale.
* Cleaning was a big high at $12/day and $0.05/mile.
* Fuel was also very high and based on 48mpg $3/gallon gas prices for $0.07/mile instead of a fraction of a cent for electricity.
* The big elephant in the room was the ""safety Oversight"" or remote operator costs.  This was $211k per year for a team.  A team could cover between 5 and 50 cars which put the cost between $0.05/mile and $2.35/mile.  They set the wage very low so that wasn't the issue.  The problem was that they had redundant operators per cluster and they topped the max number of cars covered as 2x that of other monitoring industries like air traffic controllers.
* They kept the profit numbers at $24k per car.  This would be needed at current day taxi scale, but at this profit level, Waymo would only need 400k cars in their fleet to eclipse their parent companies profits.  This number of cars wouldn't handle the transportation needs of Atlanta.  Atlanta alone would generate over $20B in profit at these rates.","Autonomous Vehicles and Public Health: High Cost or High Opportunity Cost?

I remove the EON, panda and giraffe. Then I plug the DSU back in. I don’t want the EON sitting in the sun and I don’t want the dealer asking me questions. It’s likely I know more than they do anyway. Yes, although I did not reinstall the plastic shell or remove the GPS puck. They were quite confused and tried to get me to replace parts, thinking a wire was cut (the dangling GPS wire), until I explained that it was intentional and nothing was broken. I have a tesla. I don't remove everything from the car because it integrates with the rest of the car differently than most forks, and the panda/giraffe is required for power steering. 

The service guys like trying it out and seeing how we have progressed and are always impressed with it / check it out when my car in brought in.

That said, I also have a great relationship with my service center, whereas a lot of service centers will straight up refuse to service cars when they are modified.


Overall it seems to be a pretty binary thing and completely based on the people who work there, they either love it or hate it, no middle ground. No.  Jeep dealer service guys find the OP EON hardware very ""cool"" which it is unless exposed to direct sunlight in a parked vehicle, it can easily overheat and the included cooling fan can be noisy.  I installed a Noctura cooling fan which is much (15 dB) quieter.

OEM LaneSense is a joke, not useful.  It is looking like Kia Telluride Highway Driving Assist is a lot better and nearly on par with OP and with a lot lower nag frequency (~ 1 nag/min) than Tesla autopilot, however.  OpenPilot can be nag-free. Yeah I always take my EON off the windshield when I get out of the car unless it’s being parked in my garage for the night. As many others have mentioned here, the sun and the EON do not mix well. 

When I take it in for service I take it out and switch the switches on my giraffe to stock settings so the dash isn’t freaking out on them. I don’t put the plastics up or remove my panda/giraffe however. I left everything connected for my last rav4 oil change and didn’t get any questions from the dealer. I’ve never heard of the comma.ai system. I’ve read through their website. Can anyone share some links with more in depth info on what this is/does?     
Thanks. I used to rip it all out and then started saying F it. One time when the service advisor turned on my car to get the mileage, the dash went nuts for the first few seconds like it always does. He commented repeatedly about investigating the errors which I repeatedly declined until I finally broke down. ""I use an aftermarket Lane Keeping Assist System. The errors will clear once it finishes booting up."" He looked up next to and behind the mirror before exclaiming, ""Whoa! You tapped right into the camera! That's badass!""

Another time the service manager brought my car around. When he hopped out, it was clear he wanted to ask about it. ""What...is..thaaaaat...."" I cut him off, ""It's an aftermarket Lane Keeping Assist System."" ""I THOUGHT that's what it was!"" ""Yup. It completely blows away the stock system. Like night and day.""","Those who use OpenPilot, do you disconnect/remove your gear before taking it for service at a dealership?

Does it make room for drivers that might want to come into the lane? I just drove from LA to Utah's Arches National Park using openpilot on my 2016 civic. I basically never had to touch the wheel or pedals driving through California and Nevada. Only when changing lanes and taking exits. Utah had a lot more curvey roads though and I got a lot of ""take control"" messeges due to the civic's torque limits.  Most of them were false positives though, and could ignore most of them after getting a good idea of the car's limits.  Maybe 5% of the curves in Utah were too much for the car. Probably less, but I was being cautious and took control alot.

Open Pilot's cruise control in heavy stop and go traffic entering/eaving Las Vegas also damn good.  The stock ACC in heavy trafic is pretty terrible.

It made me wonder if there would be a way to make racing safer by employing AI to monitor the track position of all cars and foresee situations such as this one and make the cars take suitable evasive action without the drivers' inputs. 

[Here is a good video to show what happened this weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznYP6_fv5U)

An active AI monitoring the race should be able to detect that Hubert's car is about to be T-boned by another driver at 180mph. If it could interfere therefore, it might be able to brake the other car and take over steering inputs and also brake the cars behind. 

I can't think of any programming issues that haven't been solved yet and I think that the closed circuit and expected behavior of the cars should reduce the variables that the system has to consider.

Anyway, I'd be interested to hear any ideas.",SelfDrivingCars,"Following a fatal accident in F2 this past weekend, I was curious to know if AI could be used to prevent accidents on race tracks?",14," An interesting thing would be whether the sport would utilize the technology if it existed. They would have to make explicit whether the danger and possibility of disaster was actually an intrinsic part of racing. Right now, they can both benefit from the excitement and also claim that crashes are unfortunate occurrences.

For example: fencing went the safety route and covers the competitors with protective gear and uses electronics to determine a point. Boxing doesn't and lets the competitors smash the shit out of each other. Which one is an order of magnitude more popular and profitable? That would make racing boring. The risk of a crash is what makes two wide going into a corner exciting. It's all about risk vs reward when guys are running laps with millisecond differences You are using AI as a blanket term here, you are looking for a monitoring system with the capability to intervene, not AI. Also, no monitoring system will be powerful enough to bring a vehicle moving 180 mph + to a halt without turning the driver into paste. You would basically have a fancy system that would be able to tell you, ""I knew they were going to crash 0.215 sec before they did"". You’re over thinking it. Longer run out and better car catching would have solved that. It’s possible that this could make racing more dangerous before it made it safer.  If drivers started to rely on the technology to give them an advantage of getting as close as possible and the technology failed occasionally that could be fatal.  If instead the technology detected a collision and prevented a driver from avoiding another collision that could be fatal too.

Unfortunately, at those speeds I think the computer or the human needs to be in complete control. Output from the AI: ""don't drive your car at 180mph"" Not sure AI would be helpful here.  The only thing I could think of is a crash alert system in each car that causes all cars to rapidly slow down. You could use censors to detect possible colisons like on road cars. How about AI controlled escape system that somehow can save the driver no matter what. That defeats the purpose of racing.

If the system didn't let you do dangerous things, you would just always do exactly the max of what the system would allow.

Crashes bring people to the audience. And deaths are pretty rare as things stand.

Oh, and the group that would be most opposed would be the drivers. You're talking about making it bumper bowling ... and declawing the cat.","Following a fatal accident in F2 this past weekend, I was curious to know if AI could be used to prevent accidents on race tracks? So, first off, RIP Anthoine Hubert.

It made me wonder if there would be a way to make racing safer by employing AI to monitor the track position of all cars and foresee situations such as this one and make the cars take suitable evasive action without the drivers' inputs. 

[Here is a good video to show what happened this weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznYP6_fv5U)

An active AI monitoring the race should be able to detect that Hubert's car is about to be T-boned by another driver at 180mph. If it could interfere therefore, it might be able to brake the other car and take over steering inputs and also brake the cars behind. 

I can't think of any programming issues that haven't been solved yet and I think that the closed circuit and expected behavior of the cars should reduce the variables that the system has to consider.

Anyway, I'd be interested to hear any ideas."

I'm not sure where 3 - 5 is.",SelfDrivingCars,"Where are level 0-5 cars on the ""technology readiness scale""?",1," I don't see the point of applying NASA methodologies to anything related to transportation.

NASA tolerates risks that would never be allowed on public roads. It had lost 2 out of 5 space shuttle orbiters, and 2 out of 135 space shuttle launches ended in a tragic loss of all on board.

Look at the FAA (ignoring the recent 737-MAX fiasco) or EASA for more appropriate methodologies. They aren't really comparable in a meaningful way.

For example, a level 0 car with no autonomy is TRL 9 because they are already well-tested, launched, and operating daily. Similarly, level 1 driver assistance is also TRL 9.

If you really want it broken down:

- Level 0 (no autonomy): TRL 9
- Level 1 (driver assist): TRL 9
- Level 2 (ADAS): TRL 9
    - Tesla 'autopilot' in its current form
- Level 3 (Conditional autonomy): TRL 6
    - What Tesla is aiming for currently (conditional autonomy)
    - What Waymo had in 2012 but decided not to bring to market because it is arguably useless/dangerous.
- Level 4 (High autonomy): TRL 9
    - Where Waymo is near today.
- Level 5 (Full autonomy): TRL 6-8
    - Nobody has this today, some would argue they are close.

For example, braking for stationary objects detected by radar would result in constant braking for metal manhole covers, overhead signs, etc. So Tesla Autopilot (and others) does not stop for stationary objects. The result is multiple crashes into firetrucks stopped at the side of the road, a fatal crash into street sweepers, fatal crashes into tractor trailers crossing the road, and a fatal crash into a lane divider.

For self-driving to work, the rate of both false positives and false negatives must be extremely low **at the same time**. By having a safety driver, a company like Uber can reduce false positives (by [not braking at all](https://www.businessinsider.com/sources-describe-questionable-decisions-and-dysfunction-inside-ubers-self-driving-unit-before-one-of-its-cars-killed-a-pedestrian-2018-10)), and rely on a safety driver to handle the false negatives this introduces.

> Sources say engineers were pressured to ""tune"" the self-driving car for a smoother ride in preparation of a big year-end demonstration of their progress, **but that meant not allowing the car to respond to everything it saw, real or not.**

It is enough for the safety driver to intervene very rarely and still be the difference between a safe testing program and a safety hazard that must be removed from public roads immediately. It's not an issue. a) false positives is a technical failure b) The car behind you should be able to brake at any time, otherwise the car behind your is at fault if it leads to a crash

you need to speak $$$ [deleted] Would be great if companies had to pass an extensive battery of tests as well as agree to record and surrender driving data for their fleet upon request.

If a vehicle cannot safely operate in the rain or snow they should be restricted to do so by law.  Vehicles should have to be approved for different types of driving.  So that on one side of the scale you have private property controlled route, 15mph max speed and on the other you have a completely unrestricted vehicle which just needs to follow local laws. If American states don't want them, please come to other countries! NHTSA plz give us matrix led headlights first. This is the same shit that coined the term jaywalking.  I'm for self driving buses and trains but personal vehicles? > ...urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to “promptly” remove regulatory barriers for cars without steering wheels and brake pedals. 

I feel like they are finally starting to feel the pain and are developing an urgency that they are about to deploy a bunch of vehicles that are fundamentally not well suited for the job.

> ...NHTSA should first work on addressing those safety standards that assume a human is behind the wheel before revising rules to address alternative seating configurations...NHTSA does not plan to begin writing rules on seating positions until March 2020. 

New seating arrangements will be a nice to have and are much easier to reconfigure after the fact if they become a big issue than the entire cockpit of the car.  Seating arrangements also take a long time to test and work out what will and won't work from a saftey and usability perspective.

> Many automakers plan remote controls to pilot autonomous vehicles through factories or onto trucks. 

I haven't heard this before.  I guess I assumed they would do something like this but it's interesting to hear what is being planed by the companies themselves.

> New York City told NHTSA it should ensure self-driving cars meet baseline performance requirements including “a high rate of accurate pedestrian and cyclist detection from all angles, the application of the brakes in time to stop the vehicle prior to a collision, and the maintenance of safe and legal speeds.” 

NYC needs to be kicked out of the conversation.  They are obviously just in it to slow down progress by suggesting that SDCs are inherently unsafe.  The statement above is so obvious in what it suggests as to be condescending to the industry.  I predict that NYC will be the last major city to get SDCs.  Not because NYC is hard but just because of the sheer corruption of their politics. Barriers..like traffic barrels. Amiright Tesla?! This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that self driving cars should be required to drive 2.4 billion miles before they’re allowed to drive with no human that can take over. 30 deaths occurs every 2.4 billion miles and 30 is like the magic number of statistics. Until then, i think someone should always be in the driver seat with some means of being able to take control. SDCs need to be locationally and conditionally certified. The 'barriers' to self-driving cars are that trillions in infrastructure investment will be required to make them safe.

The U.S. certainly does not have the money to even maintain its current infrastructure, nevermind invest trillions to enable roads for Google's little fantasy. There are still a lot of ethical, social and technological issues with self driving cars, too many to even outline. They should not be on the road yet! It’s not only about how effectively they drive but there are also legal, ethical and other dimensions that need to be sorted out. Just in terms of urban planning for example, automated vehicles radically change how a city is structures and functions, and the cars typically dont d well in hybrid environments. Will we make a av only lane? There are so many questions. They shouldnt.

Changing traffic laws requires a massive educational campaign, and has the potential to cause accidents when some drivers drive according to the old laws and some according to the new laws. *In most cases, human drivers take the reasonable risk that if they are following general traffic rules they won’t get ticketed for local offenses or technicalities.*

This is not true. People get ticketed all the time for following rules from another state. Police have zero sympathy for confused out-of-state drivers. Also, most drivers recognize rules vary and err on the side of caution if they're visiting. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

There are also unwritten local customs, from dramatic ones like the Pittsburgh left, to normal freeway speeds and entrance patterns. It varies even more internationally.

Self-driving taxis were brought up and, wow, tensions heightened...

Are self-driving taxis going to make urban rail systems obsolete for getting around major cities? 

I see some pros/cons for both sides but not a lot of studied comparisons and few calm/patient discussions on the topic. 

Here's some highlights to illustrate the acid thrown my way for simply asking about comparing self-driving taxis with the future of light rail for getting around cities:

""No. Self-driving taxis are a likely evolution of *taxis*, but though beloved of the usual libertarian-dimwit brigade, they are an insanely horrible solution to the general problem of transportation in cities.""

""Self-driving cars save on labor costs, but they only offer more of the same clusterfuck as any system based on large single-person vehicles (see: any American city).

They use tons of space, they drive development towards lower density, they essentially fuck up your city, and not just temporarily, they screw up the entire *structure* of the city; digging yourself out of the POV hole is an enormously difficult and lengthy process.""

""The light rail would be much more eco-friendly. There are also a ton of commuters who won't use a self driving car.""

are we really just a bunch of 'libertarian-dimwits' here? I can't wrap my head around a city like NYC experiencing MORE congestion from a fleet of autonomous vehicles which gum up traffic a lot LESS than human-driven taxis and I can't see small electric vehicles being more ""wasteful"" than giant elevated/dug-in train/bus networks with giant platforms (which typically run way under-capacity.)

What am I missing here?",SelfDrivingCars,The future! Mass transit vs self-driving taxis,2," From the perspective of a customer, a yellow taxi is ""self driving"". You get in, look at your phone, and when your ride is done, you get out.

Replace the driver with a self-driving system, and not much changes in an urban environment. People on this forum love to talk about things like ghost traffic jams and how SDCs will fix that. Correct. But in the city, the only issue is space. A block holds 20 cars. SDC or not, the math doesn't change on that. They all have to sit there and wait for the light to change, and repeat this every block. 

Another SDC fantasy is that we don't need traffic lights. Except in places like NYC, there are more pedestrians every block than cars. 

Now, self driving does have the potential to massively improve public transit by drastically lowering the cost of running fixed vehicles like buses or trains. You see this in places like Paris, where they converted a metro line to self driving and theres a train every 2 minutes.

...but this wont happen in NYC because of the powerful transit union. There is a ""shuttle"" that runs between Times Square and Grand Central. Just back and forth, two stations. No crossing tracks, no intersections, just straight back and forth. They tested self driving tech on it in 1960.

They just announced a massive project to rebuild the line to be accessible to those with disabilities. Guess what? Will still have a driver because of the union. \> Are self-driving taxis going to make urban rail systems obsolete for getting around major cities? 

Put this into perspective. A single L-train carries 2,000 people. The L train is 'self-driving' (CBTC & ATO) and they move as close together as they can while maintaining safe braking distance. The trains all talk to each other & control computers to make this possible. Currently 24 trains per hour each direction (1-2 minute headways during rush hour), with more coming once they add a new substation.

The size of the chassis of vehicles makes it impossible to fit this many people on the road at once. You could MAYBE fit this many people into buses, but even then, buses are lower capacity than rail cars. On top of that, you have to deal with crossing traffic, which includes cyclists and pedestrians at very high volumes -- in essence, a high-speed full auto intersection is not possible along 14th St, which the L runs under.

There's not a way to make the napkin math work here. I could see some lower capacity areas become self-driving mini buses -- 34th St would be a good case for this, as it currently has a full-size high-headway bus. Low headway, smaller buses would make sense here.

Otherwise, no, I don't see rail going anywhere once you reach scale. Short term, total cluster f.
Long term, I think we'll see all of it transformed.

Mass transit will look more like dedicated lane self driving busses or small set of train cars. Personnel would likely only be needed for security, clean up and maintenance.

Self driving pool vans moving people via HOV lanes. Lanes possibly automatically shared with busses, in a subordinate fashion, giving higher capacity vehicles priority.


Much smaller last mile vehicles for small occupancy local transit to and from stations, stops, and dynamic transition points.

And finally more traditional self driving vehicles, for regional trips for family, the elderly, handicapped, and wealthy (I expect a hefty tax on these vehicle miles + specialty subsidies). I've got some doubt about this guess.

I assume much of that based on a lane restricted, capacity based restraint setup. If that means everything other street in a city is HOV, I expect it to happen. If that means some vehicles types are restricted, or licensed, I wouldn't be surprised.

I also assume cost to approach free with energy reduction due to solar electric or carbon free hydrogen + reduced simplicity of vehicle parts and their longevity.

Left out likely ultralight Ebikes and scooters routes and or pedestrian separation or elevated trails. People aren't thinking creatively enough. SDC will have a variety of plans, that include solo travel most times, but also group travel during rush hours. Currently cars during rush hour have 1.2 people in them. So we can quadruple capacity to say 5 people without adding traffic. Maybe even more capacity with bigger vehicles. Plus traffic goes down from all the automated better driving. 

When you buy your mobility plan from Waymo/uber, the cheapest plans will include scheduled pick up for work in cars with 5+people, that still bring you door to door. They may bring you to a subway from your door if that is the fastest way to get you downtown. But it'll be timed, and a car will be waiting to pick you up at the other end. 

If you want a fancier plan, you can pay for on demand single rider cars even during rush hour. It will be extra. Think about how crappy bus travel is for low income workers, they'll now for the same cost be able to use door to door, or door to stop transport for the same price. You want a limo to yourself, they'll have those too, but you'll pay for it. >  I can't wrap my head around a city like NYC experiencing MORE congestion from a fleet of autonomous vehicles which gum up traffic a lot LESS than human-driven taxis

I mean, this claim is just based on wishful thinking. Congestion exists because there are too many vehicles and too little space. Adding more cars, whether SDCs or otherwise, creates more congestion. That's about the extent of it.

Pretty much every response you've quoted is dead-on. even Uber and Lyft have reduced subway ridership in NYC and increased congestion. a cheaper version will likely continue that trend.

&#x200B;

vehicle lifecycle cost for an electric car and a train are roughly equal when you have 4-5 passengers in the electric car. so, if all of the self-driving taxis are single occupancy, then they will be more wasteful.

&#x200B;

most of their criticisms are at least partly valid as long as the self-driving taxis are single occupancy and operate on the surface streets. that's why I'm a huge fan of The Boring Company's Loop system (not to be confused with hyperloop). they want to use 8-16 passenger vehicles (greener/cheaper than a train), dig inexpensive tunnels so you can build more routes than a subway or even surface rail, group people by destination so that you don't have to stop pods at every stop (which would put average speed above any subway/LRT/bus), and have the ability to serve the ""last mile"" by exiting the tunnel via elevator or ramp to drop people off like a shuttle bus, but also drop people at stations like a subway. that is basically the best of all worlds. it would be faster than driving or taking a train, it would cost less, could be door-to-door like a taxi (though, not quite as good because you have to drop off all 8-16 people), or run surface fixed-routes like a bus.

I think Loop is the logical conclusion if you really think hard about the subject.

* how do you avoid surface congestion? tunnels.
* why don't people like existing tunnel transit? it's expensive to build and averages 25-35mph.
* can it be cheaper and faster? yes, build a smaller diameter tunnel with no electrified rails at 1/5th the cost (actual cost today), and use on/off ramps so everyone does not have to stop at every station (now average speed went from 30mph to 100mph).
* wouldn't self-driving cars in a tunnel be more expensive/wasteful? not if you group 5+ passengers
* wouldn't a train carry more people? all but a handful of subway lines in the US carry more people than highway-density 8-passenger vehicles, and 16 passenger vehicles would be able to cover any transit line in the us. moreover, places with high enough demand could build a 2nd or 3rd tunnel, since each tunnel is \~1/5th of a subway line.
* wouldn't people still want to take a taxi for the first/last mile? the vehicles can leave the tunnel for first/last mile service when the self-driving tech gets good enough.
* wouldn't all of those mini-buses be a lot of traffic? you also let people out at stations like a subway
* wouldn't that require Tesla to develop true self-driving tech? they could operate like a subway without that, since tunnel driving would be so easy, and they also said they would allow other company's self-driving vehicles.

&#x200B;

setting the Loop concept aside for a minute, most cities would benefit from 2-3 group taxis/minibuses. even if train ridership goes down, if you can get 2-3 groups to pool into a shuttle/taxi, then you will likely have a net decrease in traffic. I imagine a minibus type thing, but with a front, middle, and rear compartment. that way, you would get riders who don't want to share transit with strangers (women often don't feel comfortable on public transit) which would pull more people out of cars and take up less road space, reducing traffic. No mention of cycleways? 

50% of the trips in Vancouver, Canada are done without a car:

[Vox - In Vancouver, 50% of trips are by foot, bike, or transit.](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/9/13897078/walkable-vancouver-video)

In Copenhagen and Amsterdam, most trips are bicycle rides. As a result, they are probably healthier than us. 

USA replaced tram lines with polluting buses:

[CNBC - Why The US Has No High-Speed Rail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaf6baEu0_w) 

And probably reduced the frequency of the buses. The answer is complex, but the answer is yes.   Mass transit is just too inefficient, as well as inconvenient, and as smaller vehicle transport starts getting better and more convenient (robotaxi) then more people will leave transit making it less efficient.  (It already uses, on average, more energy per person-mile than average cars.)

However, it's not just taxis.  The best vehicle is the van.  Lots and lots of vans with 10-15 people.  On demand. Ad hoc routes, and private taxis to and from the van. There isn't a lot of discussion around current running capacities of busses and trains in the US. I've been told by a few city planners in my city that the vast majority of bus and rail miles are at less than 50% capacity and many miles are way below 25% capacity. This really messes with the napkin calculations for both pollution, waste and congestion.","The future! Mass transit vs self-driving taxis I stumbled upon an interesting (read: contentious) discussion in another political sub about governments building mass-transit (mostly rail/light rail). Self-driving taxis were brought up and, wow, tensions heightened...

Are self-driving taxis going to make urban rail systems obsolete for getting around major cities? 

I see some pros/cons for both sides but not a lot of studied comparisons and few calm/patient discussions on the topic. 

Here's some highlights to illustrate the acid thrown my way for simply asking about comparing self-driving taxis with the future of light rail for getting around cities:

""No. Self-driving taxis are a likely evolution of *taxis*, but though beloved of the usual libertarian-dimwit brigade, they are an insanely horrible solution to the general problem of transportation in cities.""

""Self-driving cars save on labor costs, but they only offer more of the same clusterfuck as any system based on large single-person vehicles (see: any American city).

They use tons of space, they drive development towards lower density, they essentially fuck up your city, and not just temporarily, they screw up the entire *structure* of the city; digging yourself out of the POV hole is an enormously difficult and lengthy process.""

""The light rail would be much more eco-friendly. There are also a ton of commuters who won't use a self driving car.""

""a horde of self-driving taxis would actually be extremely wasteful and crowded. For example, with a lack of space and parking, they would have to continue driving around on streets 24/7, all night, even with no passengers.

More waste, more congestion. A well-built public (mass-)transportation system will always be superior. In general, well-built public systems are more efficient than their alternatives.""

As I said in the other thread, these numbers would be a lot more meaningful if we had numbers on what percent of human-driven taxis receive a five-star rating on rideshare apps. Thinking about this like a product manager. You need to divide, group, and prioritize these problems. Obviously, the biggest divide is between problems you can launch with and problems you can't. Anything grouped into safety is clearly in the later category, However, from the reporting these seemed like a minority, parking and drop off issues can be improved after launch. 

If you get a safety issue, you need to look at the ride data, see how it played out, did the driver take control, should they have, was it really a safety problem, or was  perception of safety the problem. Perhaps the car reacted well but the human didn't like it, perhaps the car should have reacted differently, even if it avoided the problem. You can't assume there is an issue just because one was reported. 

If there are 30% of riders having problems, and only a minority are having safety problems, and only some of those  problems are real. The article might be right. 

Two corollaries from this. First the difference between SF and AZ are really instructive about how well Waymo does in more complex environments. 

Second, no one is testing at Waymo's scale, and that the data they are getting from customers is really important and actionable. If your company isn't testing at this scale and collecting that data, you are really far from having a product. Waymo is creating the business processes necessary to run a service like this, they are creating the pipeline to solve problems at scale. The next step for Waymo will be to operate a mixed service, sometimes giving people a car with no backup, and other times using a backup driver. They will use software to super-geo-fence the no back up drivers. Very restricted routes and times, but they will grow that area, and scale the service.  When the mixed service generates enough revenue to cover marginal costs, they'll open a service in a second city. At that point we are in a value engineering phase. Each improvement to the software makes it more autonomous and cheaper to run, each improvement that makes hardware cheaper to build and operate makes things more profitable.  That's when you'll see major expansion. It's going to be a long process. People will complain about anything because that's we we're good at. Think about how far they've come as a company. Also it's important to note that people probably felt the same way when transitioning from horses to cars. Now, the transition is from human to robot. There will hurdles, but I think there will eventually be a tipping point where people get into an SDC and say, ""Meh, I'm at my destination."" I wonder if Waymo will make any comment or consider releasing the data (lol). Efrati's such a hack. I agree - it's very impressive. But it's hard to take the author seriously when he includes things like:

>Some of the problems will be easily tolerated in a service that's half the price of Uber (and eventually less).  

When every study I've seen suggests that the driver is only a small part of the service cost (like \~ 15%). 

> The saving factor is that teams don't improve at a linear pace. As they get more experienced, they get better at getting better. If it takes 2 years to get from 99.9% to 99.99%, it might well take only another two years to get to 99.999% and another 2 to get to 99.9999%. So while it requires going 100 times as far without a problem, it doesn't take 100 times as long to get there. 

For some problems, that's the case. For other issues, it's the opposite. It is **very difficult** to know which is the case for a research problem. No it is not a triumph, but a good first step to evaluate. But I agree with Forbes when they said it's harder to get close to 100%.","Waymo's ""Poor"" 70% Satisfaction Rate Is Actually A Triumph "

It's hilarious that they're trying to position this as a negative thing for SDCs. They're cherry-picking a few negative reviews. And very few of the negative things have anything to do with the fact that the car is self-driving - it's stuff that can happen just as easily with a Taxi/Uber/etc.

As opposed to taxis and trucking companies, which don't use public roads and/or release all customer feedback to regulators? No one has mentioned one important fact about these ratings.  This is all with a human safety driver in the driver’s seat.

So these vans will never run over a curb, have a near miss executing an unprotected left, give up and need remote assistance when trying to exit a crowded parking lot, etc.  These reviews are of  the vehicle and a human taking over whenever the vehicle is about to do something stupid.

We don’t yet have the true reviews of a Waymo vehicle driving with an empty driver’s seat. I remember back in 2010-2015 articles were like ""it'll be decades before self-driving becomes practical"". Now everyone shifted to ""years away"" and THAT'S considered a long time.

Today if you look at San Francisco that has around I think, throw out a number, 50k registered ride hailing drivers; where you can measure that it requires only 1k to 2k at peak hours.  That point should be the driver of thought of the thought leadership.

Not sure this is an apples-to-apples comparison but it is interesting.  You might have 50k registered drivers but at any given time a small minority are actually driving.  I know people who only drive one day per week almost as a hobby.  For the other side, my guess is he is talking about in a perfectly coordinated system, you could handle the transit of SF with only 1k to 2k cars and pooling.  This sounds reasonable based on numbers  I've read about for NYC.  

However, [looking at page 8 of this document](https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2019/01/sfmta_mobility_trends_report_2018.pdf) shows that Transportation Network Companies, TNCs, and Taxis make 185k intra-city trips per day and represent 16% of the 1.13m trips.  Another 450k trips enter the city and I have to assume another 450 leave each day.  That puts the total volume of trips at basically 2m/day.

The same document says the average trip length is 6 miles which would allow a single SDC to do ~40 trips/day.  At only 2k SDCs, this would require each SDC to carry 25 people per trip.  I get that a lot of this is hand waving, but a lot has to change to get that down to a more reasonable number of 6-10.  My guess is that the 2k numbers don't count inter-city travel which would get close to a reasonable number with some other adjustments in assumptions.

So I think the statement is a bit misleading. Is this on the same time line as [hundreds by 2022](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019)?",LISTEN: How Mobileye sees commercial robotaxis on streets by 2022

This guy hasn't seen the Autonomy Day  youTube video.
There are reasons why it may take longer than Elon expects, but that is nothing to do with Elon thinking in terms of physics. Good article. Are skeptical articles allowed to be posted here? 

Driverless cars are not a physics problem - they are an AI problem. i agree with the title (elon loves first principles reasoning, which works very poorly for estimating progress in ai), but found the article itself unconvincing and borderline unreadable. there is strong case to be made that elon's lack of ai background contributes to his wacky predictions, but this article doesn't make it. Elon has the advantage of seeing all of the internal developments and knowing what is left to do.

The way Elon is thinking about the problem is fairly simple and well documented.  The car needs to be “capable” of driving on all public roads.  Then he calls it “feature complete”, this happens at the end of this year.  At that point, it’s a race to deal with all the remaining edge cases.  He figures a year of that.  Then it’s turn what they have over to regulators and continue to work on edge cases.  

In 2021 he can technically geofence and say that’s what the regulators require since rules are more strict in CA and less so in AZ, NV, and FL.  Once geofenced, Tesla could optimize for where they are driving and likely achieve at least Level 3 while they work to get to Level 4. The only reason people expect SDV to have human level intelligence is because they want the cars to drive just as dangerously as humans do but do it safer. Path planning is a physics problem. If you drive carefully and following the rules, there is no need for any higher order thinking. The rules of driving are actually quite simple.",Elon Musk’s Physics Mindset May Underpin A Misguided Timetable For Full Self-Driving Teslas

Even today, people can drive up to 4 hours a day to go to work. In the future, would this become the norm?",SelfDrivingCars,Self driving car and housing,7," If this technology works, and I think it will work, cities are going to radically transform in their design. Cities, especially big cities, real estate in downtown comes at an extreme premium.  Real estate being used for parking is a sub optimal use of space.  Communities like San Francisco, housing costs well over $1000 per square foot and having a 900 square foot garage is NOT having $900k of more living space.    


Tall residential buildings are also dependent on parking.  If you want to build an 70 floor sky scraper in Los Angeles, it may house 1300 people, which would mean today it would need 1300 parking spaces nearby.  So the project may be a total no-go right now because the parking jacks up the cost and people will not pay the premium prices if they can not park at home.  This parking requirement is a major restriction on building dense housing.   But if parking was replaced with a loading/unloading system for SDC cars these mega residential towers now become viable and can actually be placed relatively close to each other with parks in between them.   This could also juice up the ridership on existing grade separated mass transit.   Not in the 2020s, but I can see the 2030s a lot of cities completely razing mid density blocks and replacing them with mega towers and allowing population density to go up 10 fold.  At these population densities things like monorails and expanding the subway system become much more viable and much more politically popular.    


According to Tony Seba, the amount of land used in Los Angeles for parking is the equivalent to 3 San Franciscos.  This means that if the parking lots in Los Angeles were repurposed to urban development the city could house 3 million additional people.  This could also allow for more green space, more mixed use space.  Greater pedestrian areas.  I actually think a lot of streets will become pedestrian malls vs car traffic.  City planners can figure out some effective way to minimize the roads car use while optimizing their pickup/drop off points and enabling a much faster flow of traffic.   People actually like really cool pedestrian zones.  Its why people pay a lot of money to go to Disneyland.  We are social animal and we like the idea of going downstairs and then walking around, seeing people, and doing enjoyable activities.  I can also envision major cities having separate pedestrian bridges in downtown areas so the people and cars never cross.    


  
How will this affect commuters?  People typically hate shitty commutes.  A shitty commute means you have to wake up an hour or more earlier.  A shitty commute means you 'work' 470 hours a year that you don't get paid extra.  A shitty commute means you spend money to get to work.   Being far removed from the urban area, your shitty commute may also mean that you live far away from other amenities.  The good restaurants may also be an hour away.  The cool parks may be an hour away.  Your friends may be an hour away.   The good doctors may be an hour away.   There are many other advantages to living in the city other than a shorter commute time.   Look at cities like San Francisco and New York.  Some people want to commute to those cities for work, but people also want to live in those cities. There's something called the [Marchetti's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant).

It states that, despite improving transportation technology, most people spend up to 1 hour commuting and that hasn't changed since prehistoric times. I don’t think 4 hour commutes will ever be the norm. Even when people don’t need to drive (ex. Public transport, chauffeurs) they tend to avoid overly long trips. There could be nonetheless a slight inclination towards people tolerating longer commutes though, but not to the extent of 4 hours being normal. My opinion is no. Look at areas where you can currently commute by rail or bus. In effect, these are self-driving cars as far as the user is concerned. But people still want to live closer to work. Why? Well, sleep for one, but also, time in a commute is not the same quality time spent elsewhere. Just like how sleeping on an airplane isn't fantastic, nor working on one. I reject the idea that people will treat time in their commute as expendable and live further as a result. It's just not supported by current similar scenarios. I travel all over the country for work. Sometimes, I'm lucky enough to get a commutable gig. Unfortunately, spending 5 hours a day on 8 trains was one such ""commutable"" gig. Right now, I'm traveling 4 hours each way on Mondays and Thursdays and that doesn't change whether I'm flying or driving.

I decided to get out of airports this year and instead bought a car specifically to use OpenPilot. It has made me think about things like converting a Toyota Sienna into a self-driving mobile executive office and finding someone to be the safety driver vs. a traditional chauffeur.

I don't need to pay for my own travel to work far from home, but I've known people who aren't that lucky. What are the chances I could find a working professional looking for a cheap ride to DC each week? What if they offered to help with gas and tolls? How would they react if I said, ""Surprise! You get to drive! It's not that bad, though, the car basically drives itself. Oh, and I'll be chilling out in the back."" I would drive myself for my 10-minute commute during the week and pick up my driver on the way home at the end of the week. 

While that arrangement piques my interest, it seems like something I'd want to wrap up in an LLC for legal protections. My point is there may be interesting ways to close the gaps in self-driving technology while the technology continues to develop. I used to work in the SF Bay Area and take the commuter shuttles. I was able to work pretty effectively on the shuttle ride which made the time spent a bit more acceptable.

Put someone in a super comfy private self driving car, I could imagine spending 3 hours driving and working on the way to the office, do a couple hours' face to face meetings in the office, driving 3 hours home. Not ideal but then you could be living on the shores of Tahoe and working in the Bay Area! Some things will happen once the shared self driving cars are unleashed..

* existing parking structures can be converted to more useable living space. 
* existing  residential garages can be converted to another bedroom. 
* workers will be willing to endure longer commutes since they are no longer burdened with the meaningless task of driving. Commuters can read, eat, nap, study. A one hour commute will be trivial if I can use it as wind down time. 
* real estate prices should plummet since there is more available housing from the converted parking spaces. 
* Commuters will purchase larger homes with land further away from their jobs. 

We will have both more sprawl and more density!

Exciting times. I can't wait to see what actually happens. I think it will depend heavily on where you are and where you work. certainly, peoples' tolerance longer commutes will go up, since it won't be as tedious. however, if lots of people start moving farther out, it will increase traffic significantly, and take even longer. on the other hand, it may entice more people to live in cities. one of the worst aspects of living in cities is dealing with cars. you're going to get dents, your insurance is higher, parking sucks, etc.. if taking a self-driving taxi becomes just a little bit cheaper, it will make more sense to use that instead of driving yourself. then, parking can be turned into green space, traffic will get calmer (\~40% of traffic in cities is from people looking for parking), pollution will decease (electric cars likey), so you then get a situation where a lot of people move closer to where they work because it becomes easier/nicer to live there without a car.

&#x200B;

I work outside of a large city, and the people who don't live in the city cite parking as the #1 reason they don't live within the city (crime being #2). that's just an anecdote, but I think it's representative of how a lot of people view living in cities.","Self driving car and housing How would self driving change the way people commute?

Waymo never says **how much rain or snow it takes** to ""affect the safe operation"". It's common to have rain and snow events that last for several hours. Do plan to leave people stranded in Waymos all over a city for hours? Do they plan to shut down service proactively on days where rain/snow is predicted so they don't leave people stuck at their destinations, unable to get back home?

If Waymo's answer is that the car will just pull over and wait out the weather, that's very dangerous. More people will die from that than from collisions.

Would there still be a need for street lights? Or would our infrastructure change to suit autonomy. i.e. no need for street lights but rather an integrated communication system that synchronizes cars to easily avoid and wait for an opening.,SelfDrivingCars,Serious question about future self driving cars and city infrastructure.,7," Pedestrians still need lights.

If you're talking about 100yrs from now on roads that humans can't get to (like in tunnels), then sure. >no need for street lights but rather an integrated communication system that synchronizes cars to easily avoid and wait for an opening.

Generally, the problem with this type of thing is how you would widely implement it securely. Sure, someone could develop a cyptographically secure infrastructure to do so, but could small municipalities execute on it?

Stop lights are easy. Do you mean street lights or traffic lights?  We'll still have both.   We'll still have lots of pedestrians, cyclists and human drivers on the roads, and they need both of those. independent traffic control is probably still a good idea. it's also unlikely to have all humans off the road in the foreseeable future, though I suppose there could be some streets that are autonomous-only. even still, I think a roundabout would move cars roughly the same volume as a dynamically negotiated system. I remain dubious of the synchronized intersection as I have seen it described.  

The obvious problem is you can't have manual cars.  In order for them to be even remotely viable, most cars would have to be autonomous.  Even then, even a small number of manual cars will cause havoc with the system and defeat the purpose of it completely.  It wwould be like having police running around with their lights on all the time and snarling up the intersections.  If such intersections were implemented, public pressure would kill off all manual cars quickly out of spite if nothing else.

So lets say everything is autonomous.  Next comes the concept of bandwidth Vs. latency.  The same way engineers say fast, cheap, good; pick two.  You can either optimize for bandwidth or latency.  Today cars and intersections have no hope of optimizing for latency so they choose bandwidth and push as many cars through as possible and only keep latency down to the point that drivers don't start running red lights out of frustration.  When most people think of synchronous intersections, they think of cars flowing smoothly by from all directions perfectly timed to slide through the gaps and not hitting anyone.  

This is possible, but only if the roads making up the intersections are lightly used.  At a certain amount of traffic, a synchronous intersection needs to convert to something much closer to what a policeman would do if they were running the intersection.  This optimizes for bandwidth.  In the end, if you use an intelligent controller even in the low usage situation, you have the same effect as a syncronous intersection, but one that can also be used by manual cars.

I'm not saying put a policeman on a box in the middle of each intersection.  I'm suggesting updating the light controller to once that can ""see"" the traffic and direct traffic through the intersection intelligently.  Let the cars be aware of all the other cars on the road and they can plan their arrival at the intersection in such a way that the intelligent control will be able to let them through.  This is uncoordinated cooperation between the car and the light controller so there are no security concerns.  The car knows that if they go 35mph until the intersection, they will be the only car at the intersection at the time and the light controller will be green for them since why wouldn't it given the state of the intersection.  Even if there were rouge manual cars, the wait would be minimal. We already have roads with no street lights not reachable for humans. They are called highways :-) I think the ramifications for city planning are immense and underappreciated.

So much traffic is borne out of how primitive our observation, communication, and cooperation abilities are when driving cars. SDCs will essentially be part of a ""telepathic network"" of intent planning and coordination, freed from the tragedies of ""one-off interactions"" (in game theory terms) that humans find ourselves in.

We'll be able to return huge swathes of our downtown cores to pedestrian streets while still enjoying liberation from traffic. Lane quantity can be reduced and redundancy eliminated. It's going to be majestic. Oops I said street lights instead of stop lights.

Cool format though.  I liked the walk-through and explanations.  And for some reason I can't put my finger on, I like the NVIDIA display.  Maybe the lane segmentation. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is basically what Tesla's auto pilot does now.  Works only on freeways, handles lane changes and transitions.

I think everyone is crazy conservative on this.  In most major cities, kids 8+ take public transportation including subways and metros.  There is no official adult around in case there is a problem and that's because problems are super super rare.  The same would be true of autonomous ride shares.  I also think this depends on the kid.  I'd have sent mine out on their own between 6-8 depnding on which one it was.

Overall, it's free as in freeware but not free/open the way you might expect a research dataset to be. Not only are you prohibited from redistributing it (not too uncommon, but still limiting), but researchers cannot publish trained models or their weights, partially or in whole, and researchers cannot use the models on a physical car apparently. There are strong guards here to prevent competition, but they also get in the way of researchers and I feel like it's not really honest to call this an 'open dataset'. If anyone has counter examples where this is actually standard practice, let me know. But I was disappointed in this move for a number of reasons. For one, it would literally be illegal for me to provide this data to someone on a metered or slow connection who cannot download the dataset themselves. This is huge, right? Or am I overreacting?

There it detected lane lines in the wrong place [removed] Do you have a dash cam footage? Also I highly doubt Tesla will delete this if you send it in, they’ll likely use it as training data. The last thing they would want is to delete this as this means it could happen to someone else again. The [comma.ai](https://comma.ai) guys sell a system similar to tesla autopilot, except that it's meant to be retrofitted into many existing cars. One thing they've talked about is how at highway speeds, their system isn't allowed to make super jerky decisions like that. They consider it a core part of the safety of their driver assist system that it'll never make a decision the driver can't easily reverse within a second.

This has some downsides, like no emergency super hard breaking if it detects an accident ahead of you. On the other hand, no trying to murder you by suddenly jerking the car into the guardrail with no opportunity for you to react. What do you mean the car’s fault? Regardless of system, 100% of driver assist technologies put 100% of responsibility on the user. Whether it’s bmw Mercedes Nissan Tesla Cadillac etc.

A company accepting liability for their program while it is active would be huge news, but it’s not likely to happen any time soon. Likely we will have robo taxis by then (which I think seem a long way out at this rate(5+ years), not just for Tesla but for everyone).

>“When I moved here it was a huge quality of life choice. I walk to work, I bicycle, I have a Vespa that I ride around. I was able to buy my first home here, which I never would have been able to do in the Bay Area,” she says. 

>Robinson’s organisation, the Detroit Mobility Lab, aims to tempt tech talent towards Michigan. Its office is in a downtown WeWork, a trendy office with the Silicon Valley company’s trademark glass booths and shared working spaces. Here, taxi app giant Lyft has an outpost, as does Bosch, as well as many smaller startups.

>The Motor City is changing. Once synonymous with decline, poverty and crime, it is now home to hipster hotels, a buzzy restaurant scene and a slew of startups working on self-driving cars, air taxis and the tech that powers them. Electric scooters dot the pavements and it has a shared bicycle scheme, shiny new buses and a freshly-launched transit mobile app. 

>Self-driving vehicles from at least three companies, Waymo, Ford, and May Mobility, trundle through the streets. And startups are coming from all over the world, including the UK, in the hope of partnering with the big American car companies that are headquartered here and creating a workforce with the engineering and manufacturing expertise they need. 

>Valerie Sathe Brugeman, of independent nonprofit the Center for Automotive Research, based in nearby Ann Arbor, says Detroit is undoubtedly on the up. “We are well on our way into the revival. Irrespective of everything that's happening on the self driving and advanced transportation technologies front, Detroit was already coming back,” she says. 

>“Because there's been a buzz about Detroit for years now, I think the automakers and other entities are realising: ‘we have Detroit right in our backyard. We ought to be doing more here’.”

>Ford, the company which 100 years ago made Detroit the centre of the automotive world, is once again overhauling the Motor City. Last year it got a $208.8m tax break to buy and redevelop vast swathes of property including the abandoned Michigan Central Station, which last saw an Amtrak train in 1988. 

>The city declared bankruptcy in 2013, brought low by mismanagement, overstaffed public services, a huge public sector pensions bill, endemic borrowing, population decline and falling tax revenues. 

>Its debts mounted to $18 billion, its murder rate was the highest in the US, and its population had plummeted from more than a million in 1990 to less than 700,000 in 2013. During the spring of 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, General Motors and Chrysler, two of the city’s biggest employers, both declared bankruptcy.

>Since then, a combination of a buoyant national economy, public incentives and private investment has prompted a revival. 

>Near Ford’s new 1.2m square foot development in Corktown, the millennials are moving in. Along the main road, trendy wine bars and noodle restaurants sit beside garages and warehouses. A shiny new block of flats is under construction.

>Its pretty residential streets, just a few hundred from the husk of the still-decrepit train station and busy Michigan Avenue, are well-kept, though there is still the odd empty plot or boarded-up building. 

>Nancy Moncivais, 59, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said it was “about time” Ford invested in the neighbourhood. She and her husband paid $35,000 for their home in 1986, and recent events have made that a very good investment. “You can’t keep a house around here. People work for Quicken Loans, they work for Ford, they work downtown.” 

>Sherif Marakby, president and CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, admits that the city can be a hard sell for workers from New York, California and Seattle who are familiar with the old stories about Detroit. “On the phone, it's more challenging than bringing them here. So we try we spend time on the phone to get people to come and visit, just come and see it for yourself.”

>Around half of his staff working in the new autonomous vehicles are new to the industry, with less than a year working for the company, and half are veterans. Middle class families have historically elected to live in Detroit’s suburbs rather than in the city proper. The newbies are changing that, he says. “People that are coming from out of town, who don't have a place, a lot of them choose to live in the city. Many of them choose not to have a car,” he says. 

>Ford is a 100-year-old manufacturing company trying to embrace Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurialism. Its self-driving technology comes from Pittsburgh startup Argo AI, and its vision for autonomous cars involves offering its services to third party firms to help transport their staff, the platform business model that has made Uber into an (unprofitable) $70bn company.

>To help speed this process it is doing a series of “culture offsites”, in the interests of helping Detroit thoroughness blend with Silicon Valley speed. These sound like very Californian occasions. 

>“The entire autonomous space is a big bold bet, because we're spending a lot of money without revenue for a while,” he says. “We talk about winning. What does winning mean? Working with the cities? What are the enablers to make us win? We talk about all of these things in our culture offsite. We're spending four or five hours this afternoon just talking about that.”

>Downtown, near the Detroit River, which separates the city from Canada, a pedestrianised square has been reclaimed from cars and is full of local workers on their lunch break and teenager zooming around on e-scooters. Across the street, an expensive health food shop opened just six weeks earlier. 

>But Detroit is huge, around 140 square miles, and outside the very centre, signs of the city’s troubled past are apparent. Boarded-up houses, buildings entirely reclaimed by nature and empty plots still dot residential streets, interspersed with beautifully kept clapboard homes painted in bright colours. 

>The city is still in the throes of layoffs, with contractors, who aren’t employees of the auto-makers but work for other companies to whom the work is outsourced, often the first to be hit. Both GM and Ford have laid off thousands from their factories, though some employees are offered work at another plant, which may be elsewhere in the country. Many jobs have been moved abroad, to China or Mexico.      

>Into the fray comes Silicon Valley company Waymo, a Google spinoff widely considered to be the most advanced down the path of creating a viable self-driving car. Patrick Cadariu, its head of vehicle supply chain operations, says 400 new jobs will be created in its new factory, which Waymo will use to kit out electric Jaguar cars with its self-driving technology.

>There’s no doubt that setting up shop in Detroit, the car-loving heart of a car-loving country, is also a good PR decision (though Cadariu says this wasn’t a consideration). A Detroit native, he discovered after the factory location was announced that his own great-grandfather worked in the same building, back in 1926.

>""He was attracted to being here at that point in time because of the opportunities that this innovation created, and I'm back here after being gone for a long time, for similar reasons,"" he says.

>“You've got this incredibly rich engineering, manufacturing tradition...I always wanted it to be here. That was my clear bias from day one.”

>He says he wants the new  jobs to go to locals. “It's not about transferring or shuffling people around. It's about creating new jobs and creating new opportunities here, and having Detroiters and people from Michigan with the first shot at that.”

>One interesting challenge for Waymo could be interacting with the powerful unions which negotiate on behalf of the local workforce, something it is unlikely to have encountered in Silicon Valley. Cadariu says it’s too early for the company to be engaging with that, and hints that it might not even have to. “The type of work we do, and even in our final assembly processes - it's very different from what you what you would expect from the traditional automotive OEM factory.”

>Self-driving car companies want data, and Detroit is a haven because of the wide variety of streets - and behaviours - that are found here. On a ride downtown in one of Ford’s cars, fitted out with sensors developed by its Pittsburgh-based partner, startup Argo AI, we encounter roundabouts, one-way streets, illegally parked cars and pedestrians wandering into the middle of the road without the right of way. 

>Waymo, too, has been testing its cars here, to assess their ability to handle snow, a bugbear for self-driving cars. The light beams emitted by Lidar, which allow cars to “see” the world around them reflect off snowflakes, rendering them ineffective. In Detroit, it typically snows 36 days out of the year, making it an ideal testing ground for overcoming the snow problem. Its low density also means it has less of a traffic problem than other US cities. 

>But the only company actually putting the public in its cars is shuttle company May Mobility, which takes staff of property management firm Bedrock on a short 800m route around part of the downtown area. Paywall Detroit gets the press, but Pittsburgh is where it's at. Robotics and engineering talent coming out of one of the top robotics programs in the country + an inexpensive city that isn't 50% postapocalyptic. I think Detroit's renaissance is not so much self driving, but tech in general embracing a cheap city with room to grow. 

10 years ago I never would have considered Detroit, but now living in the bay for a good while... Maybe Detroit would be nice. Interesting. I ran a [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/AutonomousHoag/status/1108868275365015552) back in March asking people's thoughts on precisely this question (including Pittsburgh, too).

He can see okay in front of him in daylight, so he lets my mom drive at night. But he has problems with peripheral vision, so any time he makes a left turn, or has to turn from a stop sign that is not a 4-way stop, he isn't paying attention. He doesn't even turn his head.

My dad now thinks that he can get a car with forward collision avoidance, and that will solve his driving issues.

If he has enough money to keep buying new cars, why not just get a driver? Tesla? I encouraged my 80 year old parents to get one because it’s the safest car on the road, period. I don't believe any car has a complete solution.  Volvo has a system to mitigate turning into oncoming traffic during a left turn.  Audi and Lexus have a system to mitigate entering an intersection with cross traffic.  Neither will eliminate the possibility of an accident, they have serious limitations (size and speed for cross traffic, headlights off for oncoming traffic).  IIHS says cross-traffic systems can prevent maybe 20% of accidents.  

Certainly these systems are better to have than not, but they will not make your father a safe driver.  Look into what your city has for seniors, many cities have dial-a-ride which is equipped for seniors or a discount for public transportation.  Some cities also have a discounted taxi or ride-share service.  If your father

There are also special driver training classes for seniors to help them remain safe drivers.  Seniors have very limited vision and reaction time even if they're checking correctly at intersections and need to drive differently.  One of the biggest benefits of these ADAS systems that don't work super well (like lane-keep assistance or cross-traffic alert) is people who don't turn them off tend to start driving safer to avoid the annoying beep, but it's important to remember you can't rely on the system and continue being trained in good driving practices. Audi Intersection Assist (for the A8): [Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u5o2lfyQOM). The A8 is even going to [lift itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh6xFg8ypDQ) in case of a side impact to protect the passengers. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_assistant), there seem to be cars from other manufacturers with intersection assist, but I haven't experienced those.

But keep in mind that cross traffic systems have a really narrow sphere of action. They are supposed to protect you on crossings, but should not erroneously brake when you enter a round-about. So, for example, they might stop other cars from crashing into you, but not you crashing into other cars (which are different situations with different relative speeds and estimated points of collision).","Currently available self-driving features for *side* accident avoidance? My senior citizen father should have quit driving when he totalled an almost new car a year ago. He can see okay in front of him in daylight, so he lets my mom drive at night. But he has problems with peripheral vision, so any time he makes a left turn, or has to turn from a stop sign that is not a 4-way stop, he isn't paying attention. He doesn't even turn his head.

My dad now thinks that he can get a car with forward collision avoidance, and that will solve his driving issues. Previously he was claiming that driving during the day on familiar roads is no problem. But his accident was at one of the intersections where he's driven multiple times a week for 30 years. My mother thinks that if she's in the car with him, she can watch for hazards. However, there are frequent situations where and I both scream when he turns into the path of an oncoming car and moves slowly, and his reaction is to slam on the brakes when he should hit the gas.

Are there any collision avoidance systems that will handle turning into the path of oncoming cars, or not checking both ways when going from a stop sign? And what cars might have that available now.

I don't know if he is trying to bribe the kids into letting him keep driving by saying he's buying a new car and letting the kids have the year old car that he bought after totalling the last one. He says the dealership told him it had the safety features he had in the last car (which didn't stop the accident) and it didn't, which is why he heeds a new one."

They want to build the sensors, computers, and software. Not try to compete with car manufacturers.

One day you'll be able to buy a car ""powered by Waymo"", but not a Waymo Car. [deleted] Love hearing programmers say manufacturing is really hard.   Wonder about the reverse.... Very, very, smart move.  It is going to be a few years, and a lot of wacky designs, before we even know what consumer SDC's will physically look like.  Will they be windowless pods?  Will they be like a living room?  Will they be like a bus?  Will they be like a limo?  We have no idea.  

It could well be that car companies have zero value when it comes to developing SDC's.  And I would assume that any money Google puts into trying to develop manufacturing capability at this stage would just be wasted money. *""... making cars was ""really hard"".""*

Maybe it's the native Detroiter in me, but.

DUH. They are preparing themselves for a sale. Building a car is only a distraction for a car company if they don't want to appear to be a competitor to a different car company. This is a significant contraction from the original Waymo concept. Building a car is, however, a significant distraction to an advertising search company feeding money into a spinoff which brings in no revenue.

End of the day, the automobile industry is fully vertically oriented, for good reasons. The sensor package needs specific mounting spots on the car. The car needs full integration of mechanical and electrical systems. You need locations for the actuators for steering, braking and accelerator, turn signals, etc. Modifying cars in a chop shop is not a long term sustainable business model. The whole system will have to be redesigned every year as the auto company changes their designs. A simple change of a mounting bracket, for instance, might cause a full redesign of the actuator package. It'd be a mess. And if they are going to get in bed, so to speak, with a specific company, it makes no sense to open a new factory to install sensor and actuator packages. Do that in the car factory while it's being built.

Stapling a self driving system onto an already manufactured car, heavily modifying a car already off the manufacturing line, only makes sense in the long run as a proof of concept for a more integrated product. They are looking to sell, but they don't have a buyer yet. Google has enough money to just purchase a car company outright. Once the design is finalized, Google can purchase Subaru, hyndaii or Nissan and just have them make the self driving track similar to how they use asus to build the chrome book laptops.

Goggle is winning this race. > There's other people that are very, very good at making cars, and they should do that, and we'd love to work with them 

But there aren't any companies that are very good at making the kind of car you need for a SDC taxi.  Waymo itself proved that over the years as they have struggled to find such a car.  I think this is where they are going to fail if someone like Apple, Tesla or GM can catch up with them on the AI side. The world has more existing car making capacity than will be needed for sdcs. They'll churn em out like hotcakes. Same color, same everything. Yeah, they stated this a long time ago. Waymo is essentially a software company, not an automotive OEM. Whatever! Waymo will have to get more involved in the design of vehicles if they perfect their driver. This is part of running a successful service, or a portfolio of successful services, as is most likely. How they organize to accomplish that, just isn't too important. The right choice just may not be obvious right now. 

Likely guess is google will be buying skateboards (Battery, drive train and tires, maybe frames) and outfitting them with bodies and interiors and sensors. No reason to design and build drive trains, lots of reasons to design interiors and exteriors. There is also a bunch of regulatory work needed to make this happen.  Probably lots of safety standards will go a way if SDC are safe enough. Skateboards can be designed for easy repair and refresh.

SDC's will have a number of uses, and require many different shapes and sizes. From fleet logic, it makes sense for these vehicles to be basically the same underneath, or too at least have a minimum number of possible configurations. Buying Jags, Pacificas for the same task only makes sense as a short run strategy when value engineering this part of the business isn't that important. This seems pretty obvious. Building cars is incredibly capital intensive and there's so many auto makers who are desperate to build cars at Google's scale. Google would much rather drive all of those automakers margins down to zero",Google spin-out Waymo rules out building its own self-driving cars

The 'haves' will be able to commute between pockets of affluence without the bother of hiring a 'have not' driver or seeing the 'have not' neighborhoods in between. Roads will get more congested because even though there will be less accidents, more people will be driving because of the extra convenience. Car ownership for low income people can be a massive economic drain and a source of considerable economic anxiety.  The car they need to own so they can go to work can cost them randomly a few thousand bucks should something go wrong.   TAAS will enable the lowest income people in society to have the same high quality transportation that NEW car ownership would offer them at a drastically lower, and predictable rate.   They will not need to save money to buy some used bucket of bolts or have to go into debt to fix their car.     Its pretty fucked when a person has to use 3-4 paychecks to fix their car and 2-3 paychecks to fuel it, and 2 paychecks to insure it.  For a low income person car ownership is a massive liability, but one they have to take on to get to their job.   For people who can't afford the car in the first place, finding work is drastically harder and the options they have at hand are typically not very great.   Many lower income folks in cities can't justify paying for parking in their own neighborhood and with this technology they will not have to.    Uber as is already goes 5x-6x as fast as the bus from door to door, and this does not take into consideration odd bus timing (such as the bus dropping you off at work 15 minutes after your boss wants you at work, resulting in you taking an earlier buss and waiting around for 45 minutes before you start) and if you have to take multiple buses Uber much faster than 6x as fast.   In 2005 I used to had to take two buses from my house to a college campus to take a course I needed (the college I normally attended was 1 mile from my house, in a neighborhood I grew up in).  This two bus system resulted in a 2 hour trip from my house to the classroom,  a trip which is normally a 20 minute drive.   Imagine if that was work, and an employee had leave 140 minutes early to get to work on time.   It also turned a 2 hour class into an all day 6+ hour ordeal.  And if I had to stay late to do something I would have to sit and wait for another hour for the next bus.   The daily pass was also $5 per day (I only needed it twice a week)  


For people in food deserts, or far removed from commercial, social, educational, and health services, TAAS will allow them to get to where ever they need to be at a drastically cheaper cost than any alternative.   Even if the government pays some monthly amount of their TAAS budget as  welfare program this will be far more empowering than whatever limited public transportation they may currently have.   They can take a job anywhere and know with confidence they can get to work every day regardless of where the job is in their community.   They won't have to go into major debt or take on a major responsibility.    


  
This service will allow rural people, people who are far removed from airports and transportation hubs to get to their longer range destination by a sleeper car showing up directly to the home at say 8pm, and then driving for 13-14 hours while the rider watches TV and sleeps to take them to their destination the following morning that is 700 miles away.   They can wake up refreshed and get anywhere they want to go.  


Being lost will be a thing of the past. Pretty much anywhere you are you will just summon a ride to take you home.   You can go to a city you have never been to, perhaps even a city in a foreign country where they do not even speak English, and immediately summon a ride, which communicates to you in English, and takes you exactly to where you need to be.    


For the United States in particular, the shift to TAAS will completely redesign our cities.   I am convinced the adoption of TAAS will be finished by 2030, but the building of buildings to accommodate this new change will still take a while.  But in some cities will happen very quickly as real estate is in an extreme pinch and during a 2 acre parking lot into a 50 floor building will make some investors a lot of money.    


2040 will look extremely different.   American cities will look different.   There will be much more high rise buildings as parking will not be a limiting factor.  There will be much more green space within the cities.  Loading zones will be everywhere, but fleet charging will mostly be out of site.  Parking lots will mostly not exist.   Areas will become more pedestrian friendly and some places could remove roads to make a more Disney park like feel with TAAS cars in specific service areas.   2040 will look like the future.    


  
Most gas engine cars will end up off the road.  They may be used for private recreation on private roads and some public roads certain times of the day.  But most will end up as collector's items, or in museums to 20th and 21st Century artifacts.  Your typical ICE car will have a negative value, you will have to pay someone to take it off your hands.   It will be like getting rid of an old mattress, no one will want it.    Car maintenance and repair will still be a thing but car mechanics and their businesses as we know them will die out.   TAAS companies will have in house service or contract all their service out to specialists.  No more consumer to Mechanic relationship.  Engine mechanics will probably shrink 10 fold between now and 2030.     When the majority of people no longer own ICE cars, and I don't mean everyone, just the majority, more than half, we will see the politics change drastically regarding cars.  No longer will parking be a major political priority.  No longer will gas taxes be unpopular.  I could definitely see more cities banning ICE cars, especially older cars and diesels, from city centers (that one is already happening in Europe).    The majority of people who don't use gasoline will see no problem drastically raising a gas tax on the minority who do.  When it goes to the polls people will vote to fuck gasoline.   Driving a gas powered car 10 years from now could be a very weird thing to do and much more limiting than it is now, you could find parking in the city to be difficult and gasoline taxes making gas extremely expensive and then some places you are just now allowed to be.    


Gas stations will disappear.  Especially within the city where there will be several gas stations within a short distance of each other.  There will be a lot of issue about environmental contamination from their tanks leaking.  I know a geologist who worked in this area and he claimed it was always going to be big problem of the future.   But because the land is so valuable, it will get cleaned up and the gas stations will be repurposed into something else, in denser areas this will most likely be a tallish building with commercial services at the bottom and residential on top. What reason do they have today? AVs patrol themselves. Fewer police officers will be needed. The ones that are needed will spend more of their time stopping crimes and less time writing speeding tickets. This one is interesting imo, I personally wonder how motorsport would be affected, I still think racing should have 0 AI driving except for basic stability and traction control if needed, what would be interesting is a self driving division, just dont mix it in with everything else. Potholes will get fixed faster. Companies that own the software and the fleets will constantly be scanning the roads and identifying, locating, and determining the size severity of potholes. They will also be looking to monetize this data so they will sell it to cities. Cities will have real time information about where every pothole is and which need patched the most.","For better or worse, what are some of the less talked about affects that autonomous vehicles will bring?

> 2. How well does the navigation handle being interrupted and sent in what may be a very non-ideal route?

This should be a non-issue.  If you have used any navigation software, it would work just like that and route like you missed a turn or something.  The only issue I see is you could force an SDC onto a route that is outside it's Geo-fence which would be a problem for sure.  As the service areas get larger this is less likely to happen.

What is more important is that as SDCs become more common and cities start to regulate them, a lot of new possibilities open up that never existed before.  As an emergency worker, you could have the road shut down to through traffic.  This would feed into the fleet systems in real-time and they would avoid using the road if possible.  You could do this today, but it would only reach a small minority of drivers and even those would probably ignore it.  SDCs would always avoid the road. https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/02/20/waymo-obeys-a-cop-at-broken-traffic-signal/ Of course, as yet no cars are deployed, so you can't ask ""how do?"" but rather ""how might?""   But the core answer is, ""they will do what is needed, because they can't deploy without this ability.""   Some teams have demonstrated abilities and understanding police officers directing traffic so work is underway.

So the first way is to try to understand the flagger's signals.   However, only the first car needs to do that, because it will report up to HQ that the road is closed (or other special situation) and most other unmanned cars will use different routes, unless there is no other route.

They may use data networks and get help from a remote operations center, if the flagger needs to give complex instructions.

Ideally, the flagger will use an app on his or her phone to publish the location of the traffic problem and some basic facts about it.  So no unmanned car may ever encounter the flagger at all.    If there is no data signal, and nobody who has signal is aware of the problem, then it will have to wait for the first car to leave the scene to report it.

If there is a competent human in the car, they will interact with the flagger, and give some basic inputs to the car to turn around, take alternate routes etc. if there is no data.  Usually there will be data.

So the only real question is about an unmanned car in an area with no data who is the first car to come upon the flagger, and the flagger does not use any type of hand signal which is common or is used by other flaggers.  The car will know all the common hand signals on its own.   In that case, the car might just sit there until they can find somebody who knows the hand signals. They will mow them down, but eventually Tesla's neural net would learn that is not okay. But the first few hundred is going to have to sacrifice for science. j/k but not really... [removed] None of the major players handle this right now from what we've seen. However, following social media, it seems the main players in a given area (SF+bay area at least) have been keeping in contact with their local law enforcement personnel to develop techniques to handle self driving vehicles in the future, similar to how Tesla maintains a relationship with local firefighters to offer guidance on dealing with battery fires. 

Ultimately, I'd imagine the biggest players right now are planning on taking over remotely with a human in the scenarios you are describing, also known as tele-operation. Last year, somebody (Volvo?) put out media of “pose estimation” using LiDAR. They were able to build little stick-figure skeletons of humans captured in point-clouds. Using this, they were able to parse what motions a traffic control person was making. I have a Tesla Model X and it would not be able to follow instructions. But I have experienced that it will give control back to the driver if a road pattern is too difficult for it to interpret in time. This is where the driver should take over even before the car deciding anything [deleted] The reality is that many systems on the market today can stop for stationary obstacles and people. The better ones can handle moving obstacles. But that is about as good as it gets on vehicles you could go out and buy today.

As for research and development platforms, I've seen several that can follow cone paths. However I am not aware of any systems that can take directions from emergency personnel. That would involve identifying emergency personnel and interpreting their actions. I remember that Waymo has given several talks where they mention intention recognition of pedestrians and cyclists, but that was in the context of predicting the path of said pedestrians and cyclists. Since there are no real self driving cards now, they don't handle traffic flaggers at all. As far as the few that are in trials now with small areas of operations and fully 3D mapped routes, again not at all. The best you can hope for is it won't run you over while you stand in the middle of the street. The short answer is they don’t. In theory they should be able to when full self driving happens. But so far no one knows when it will happen or even if it will happen or not.","[Question] How well do self-driving cars handle traffic flaggers?

I am going to assume that the car is owned by a fleet company and not your personal car.    First.  The door would be locked and the rider would have some way to summon help and the system would immediately dispatch the police to the scene.  The cars will also be covered with cameras and will record criminals interacting with the car, thus enabling their future prosecution.  The system would also have a record for how many times it happens, where it happens, and what to do to anticipate future problems.   The hitch hiker scenario will be less likely because such a person would just call up their own car to pick them up.  If someone is in a state of distress in the road the car can also call up emergency services to go help them.   Likewise if there is some object in the road the car could notify traffic control, hit reverse, and wait for someone to come around and fix it.

Maybe we need to improve more till den IDK who's gonna suffer in test and trial mode Wow, this is really sad.

I know this area well. Card Sound Road is an isolated stretch of highway, a perfect place to use Autopilot. It's also very common for people all throughout the keys to be pulled over on random parts of roads, enjoying the beaches, swimming and fishing. 

The intersection of this Card Sound with 905 is a T shape. My guess is the Tesla driver was enjoying AP on Card Sound and perhaps dozed off/perhaps was drunk/became complacent in some way and totally missed the end of the road, and continued on into the cleared brush until the car hit the pedestrians and stopped in the brush (you can see part of this in the video). The pedestrians were 40 feet off the road(!). How did AP not react to the traffic signs which obstruct the end of the highway? How does one do this without attempting any correction?! 

The on-scene investigation seems to have been handled poorly, no ticket issued, no sobriety test of any kind was given to the driver. Really makes me wonder who the driver ""knows"" 🙄

We don't know the whole story here yet, but I have to say...

I like Tesla, but I think their cost-cutting when too far the day they decided to release an L2 system called ""Autopilot"" without a proper driver monitoring system.

""*We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run""*  


We seem to have two types of predictions.  One prediction is that Self Driving Cars will be here tomorrow and the other prediction is other extreme that self driving cars will start to take hold several decades away.  Decades.  Not years.  Decades.    


Both are clearly wrong.  The early prediction folks are the easiest to disappoint because their early prediction didn't come true.   However, to their benefit, there has been considerable progress every year along the way.  Whatever goal we have, we are clearly getting closer to that goal.   The fact that so many players are in this space, all spending a great deal of money in solving this problem is progress.    


The extreme pessimists are much more difficult to disappoint.  However, their forecast of several decades away is silly.  Technological capacity increases by many orders of magnitude over decades.  My 1998 iMac had 32 megs of RAM, you get an Apple Watch now with like 768 megs of ram.  Explaining someone in 1999 that in 20 years a wrist watch will have more computational power than their desktop computer would come off as silly.   The monitor technology didn't exist, the hard drive didn't exist.    A modern desktop computer would be an absolute super computer by the standards of 20 years ago.   Everything about self driving cars is technology based and improves every year.   20 years from now computers will be a factor of 1000 times as powerful as they are today (and 100,000 times as powerful 30 years from now).    


This is the tech prediction I have made, and I make about most technologies.  That prediction is.  every year that goes by the investment capital into Self Driving Cars grows.  The engineering talent, the budgets, the number of companies in the space.  Every single year the capital going into this is increasing.  The result is that each year the rate or progress increases.  As the progress increases more people aware of the opportunity and invest more money into it.   This is a feedback cycle of progress, the progress in the space brings in more money which produces more progress.   This prediction is all about a constant acceleration and improvement.   But its also why there is far more money invested in 2019 than there was in 2009 and also far more progress in 2019 than there was in 2009.    


This nonstop progress is eventually going to hit a point where the technology works in a certain marketplace, in certain conditions, and will launch commercial service.  This commercial service will not be the end of cars, but will be the beginning of the transition.   Self Driving Cars do not have to work everywhere to work.  They just have to work in their respective marketplaces and then over time those marketplaces will grow.  It doesn't matter if the technology doesn't work in snow covered and sparsely populated Wyoming , if it works in Arizona it will launch in Arizona.  If it works in California it will launch in California.    I think we will see Arizona, Nevada, and/or California service go live at somewhere around Summer 2021/2022.  Maybe not everywhere in the states, but it will be a thing that people in these areas will use.   All eyes will definitely be on this part of the country and competitors will be racing to deliver their own technology and expand the marketplace.   I think the following years after that there will be service very quickly spreading elsewhere in the country and most likely in cities in the sunbelt.  The development will continue and the technology will continue to improve allowing the cars to better handle rain, snow, fog, and other conditions which are an issue in other parts of the country.  Voters elsewhere in America will want this technology and vote for politicians who have plans to make their roads work with it if need be.     


I think this process will mostly be over by 2030.   There will be disruption regarding new car sales in urban/suburban markets likely within a year or two after SDC launches in those areas that will just get worse and worse every year.   We are gradually starting to see this as something like 10% of people who sell their cars don't buy a new one.  If that jumps up to 30% of people who sell their cars don't buy a new one the market will become rich with used cars and poor with new car buyers.     


TLDR:  Progress in this sector brings on more investment into this sector, more investment produces more progress, which brings on more investment.  Eventually the progress hits a benchmark where it can go live in select markets. That's really nothing in the grand scheme of things when we consider the scale of changes to society and global infrastructure that we're talking about with SDCs. And it's not like we have nothing to show for it. Self driving cars literally exist. 

We're going to look back in a decade on all these people so eager to declare SDCs a failure, and they're going to seem like the ""heavier than air travel is impossible"" or ""the human body can't withstand travel at speeds greater than a horse can travel!"" types. Long roads are no concern as long as the car self drives there! Meh. It'll just give everyone else more time to try to catch up to Waymo. Rode in one as part of a beta testing program. It had a couple of moments where the wheel started jumping around as if it was glitching, it was pretty unsettling. Def get less safe than with a human driver.  They have some kinks to iron out still The mass media is coming into realization what the Auto industry knew all along. It's a long road but the industry has been taking the right steps to get there I think the people who are disappointed and disillusioned at this point never understood the reality of the challenges from the beginning.
There is real, tangible process. Probably not as fast as many would like, but it is there to see.

If you get caught up in the hype, you're always going to be disappointed. This is not limited to SDCs. > Chinese startup WeRide joins auto giants in delaying plans for fully autonomous operations

I love it! ""We're just as good as the big boys! We too can't do autonomous driving."" I remember intense hype in 2015, when barely anything worked yet. Tesla autopilot, waymo driving a blind guy, fireflies little cars that ""will drive people soon!"".

We compared camera and LiDAR training data to put the two self driving methods to the test.,81," they are proving the obvious, a system with lidar is inherently better and easier to build.  The question is if it's worth the cost.  Musk seems to think not, but.... No one can be right or wrong about it until someone actually accomplishes a fully autonomous car.

If this article didn't use a click bait headline I would have been interested in it's content. Can you make FSD work with only cameras as your primary sensor? Yes. 

Will it be the safest option out there: Probably not. Isn’t the idea behind Tesla‘s vision that humans don’t have LIDAR as well and are still capable of driving perfectly fine (the most of the times) although thinking of hundreds of silly things and doing other stuff while driving? So it‘s maybe just a matter of time to improve the driving AI which should by then even be a better driver because it has just one task: drive safe?!
If the AI is good enough, there will be no need for LiDAR imho. The question is just what arrives first and can scale down the prices because of mass selling. The Walkman analogy above was pretty good I think. I wonder if there is a solution where some amount of LIDAR+Camera cars run around generating a high quality reference training data that can be fed into Camera only cars to get their models to a point of competence. Commercial operators would then be able to offset the higher cost by selling their LIDAR data to consumer level solutions that rely on camera only and may be limited to the regions and modes of self driving. They were using lidar and camera from Aptiv. Perhaps their algorithms for interpreting data aren't as good a Tesla's. It just seems pretty bold to assume that Aptiv can't so Tesla can't either. When will headlines of these articles stop implying that the use of these sensors are mutually exclusive ??? There’s so much flaw in these tests I don’t even know where to begin... First, these are long-tail counter-examples of a scooter and partially obscured car. I understand that the long tail of LIDAR failures is much, much longer.

Second, the error of vision-only is acknowledged. It was acknowledged at Autonomy Day. Vision has to improve. The message delivered by Elon and Andrej was “once vision has it, LIDAR is done forever”. This article seems strangely bias. It didn't speak at all about the mechanical properties of the LIDAR being really difficult to stay reliable. Camera systems have been ubiquitous in consumer products for so long that it's obvious to include them in cars. Even LiDAR cars incorporate Backup cameras and the such. 

&#x200B;

If our eyes are able to properly discern the world enough to drive at speeds, it's completely conceivable that we can attain this level of accuracy using computer vision. Roads were designed for eyes, not lasers. How can a laser see a stop signal?

To so quickly dismiss stereo vision as a resolution issue is short-sighted. Just look at how quickly megapixels in your phone attained 4K level. A single LIDAR system costs magnitudes more than a handful of cameras. 

&#x200B;

In addition. Tesla or any other system is not trying to rely on one system entirely. Every company is incorporating multiple technologies in sensor-fusion to create a virtual understanding of the world. There is always multiple layers of sensors working together to produce a real time understanding of the position of the car.

The truth is Arizona is a hotbed for SDC testing because of its lax regulations. Doing something about it would only raise more publicity for this tragedy, and not in a good way.

* First to market L4?
* First to market L5?
* The one who kills the least people along the way? 

What a time to be alive 👽 [removed] Cities and Suburbs will win, very rural areas will ~~loose~~ lose.  The areas near but not in major cities will be a wash. There will be many winners, it's a big global market with lots of cities, and the tech has to be made to work on a street by street, city by city basis, leaving room for many competitors for the first decade at least.  Maybe later somebody will be so good as to push out the early movers in the different cities, but it won't be for a reason we know today.

The only very likely winner at present is Waymo, but there will be others more visible soon.    Look for people willing to deploy at all with no human in the car (which even Waymo has barely done) and people willing to publish very high numbers for miles driven per \***necessary**\* intervention. There are at least two types of SDC companies: The ones that build software and cars, and the ones that build only software (in case of Waymo, left aside they build some of the required  hardware, too). On the software side, we can tell that Waymo is already the winner: Now that they have shown that they have the ability to let the cars actually go around without test drivers, it won't be too long that they can accumulate a million kilometers day by day (imagine a fleet of 2.000 cars, each going 500/day - seems plausible). No other competitor will be able to catch up in time. Regarding car manufacturers, the winners will be the companies that are chosen by Waymo to use their borg kit.

Addendum:  Tesla may once have the best L3 system ever seen, but there is absolutely NO chance to make it safely to L4 without relying on accurate street mapping (and LiDAR) and without honing thousands of edge cases. I found Geo Hot's (CEO of Comma.ai, the only open source self driving company) talk on the state of self driving pretty eye opening. He really cuts the BS and talks about who's ahead. https://youtu.be/iwcYp-XT7UI Nobody knows.

* drives straight on a highway; not in cities which are much tougher to navigate;
* uses only one LiDAR on top, which may be ok for highway drive on that car, but probably inadequate for driving in cities;
* multiple cameras visible (on roof backwards pointing, some at the front)
* LiDAR roof rack is still rather experimental and rough;

They might never be able to turn a profit.

Both Lyft and uber are bleeding money. Driverless cars aren’t a silver bullet either because it fundamentally changes their business model. Sure they might not have to pay for drivers, but now they have to buy a depreciating asset and operating on new territory. It’s not like car rental companies are swimming in money today, and they don’t pay for drivers either. I guess Uber and Lyft will both keep losing money until one of them goes out of business, then they can raise rates to earn a profit as long as they are below taxi levels

Right? Or is there something else hurting them besides a rate war? ""We created a phone app to pay people to drive cars. That's basically the same as building an engineering/logistics firm to develop all sorts of av/transport/shipping technologies, right?!"" I wish I had the discipline to short this company.  Ticking time bomb at these valuations and tapered growth. Seems like it would be pretty expensive to freeze a bunch of people you just hired. Plus they would probably get hurt. Not a good move, would be cheaper to set them on fire imo, but I am not a businessman so don't take my word for it.

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/ We don't know if it was on auto-pilot. Of course the driver would say that, but we don't know.

And Tyler Durden isn't where you should be getting your facts from.

I saw the video of the collision and that's not how auto-pilot drives. That's how a distracted driver drives.

But we'll see after the actual investigation. If Tesla says it was autopilot I'll believe it. Anyone survive? Well, try driver is claiming he was attentive and he missed it, or at least missed that autopilot would not handle it and presumably did not take control of steering.   This is one of the UI issues with tools like autopilot -- how good are the drivers are knowing when to take control.   You can quickly come to believe, as many I know have, that you are taking control too often, and end up doing it too little.

This is one of those things that computer vision systems have an issue with -- things they have never seen much before. As a test of Tesla's methods, they should now be putting a request into every Tesla ""please send any images of a car and tow truck stopped on the side of the road.""  Except, I am pretty certain they already knew about that as a problem, since they study every accident and their have been accidents like this before.   So they should have, long ago, gotten lots of images of this sort, tagged them, and put them into their training data.

Yet it did not work.   Tesla is not a self driving car, but it promises it is just on the verge of being one, and this is difficult to credit. something something driver to blame Is this the first time there have been serious passenger injuries in an autopilot-related crash?","Watch: Tesla On Autopilot In Moscow Slams Into Tow Truck, Explodes Into Flames "

Should we take him seriously?",SelfDrivingCars,How legit is George Hotz? Anyone use Open Pilot and want to explain your experience?,83," Definitely.

I'm a core developer for the Tesla OpenPilot Fork and have driven over 30,000 miles with OpenPilot. It works better than AP1 for everything but stop & go traffic, and it only fails there because pre-AP tesla's dont have an iBooster to control the friction brakes, so our fork has to use the regenerative brakes which only slow the car down to ~6 mph.

The current model is great, steering controls (on a pre-ap tesla) is much smoother than AP1 or AP2+. If you look at a Tesla on Autopilot's steering wheel when doing long and sharp turns, you will see it jerk quite a lot, OP has none of that in their current model. The only issue it really has is some cars don't have EPAS' with enough torque for some sharper turns. The new 2019 corolla, that is officially supported, and obviously Tesla which have the same EPAS as new teslas, have a strong enough EPAS to make every turn.

While the current model is extremely good, it's based on current machine learning practices of label everything, build models, test what is produced. Not much different than every other self driving company out there, but definitely the best executed experience thus far when it comes to highway driving. hands-free perfect steering with driver monitoring just cannot be beaten. 

However... Comma has some seriously advanced ML Stuff happening internally which they want to release in the future (maybe v1.0.0?) that is similar to Tesla's ""Dojo"", and in that aspect are years ahead of most self driving companies. When he talks about ""laneless"" models, It's pure unsupervised learning with no labeling of lines or cars or anything, Similar to how alphago learns by playing against itself, the model learns from driving against 12 million miles of real drivers.

Knowing the George and the Comma team, some of who are far better than George at ML, I'm extremely confident that they will be able to pull it off too, even if they are a couple years behind Tesla in doing so. He’s not an expert at ML with the long history that you’ll find at NeurIPS, ICLR, ICCV, but he’s well known as a capable and frank developer. His interview with Friedman is an honest and open account of his experience. 

My main takeaway is as a dev you’re only as good as your tools and Hotz is at the top percentile at building tools. The hacking skill set is transferable and he later picked up best practices at FB and Google. He doesn’t strike me as deceptive as to the capabilities of his system. The system is in its current form a mod kit for a very limited set of newer vehicles. 

If there’s a criticism of his approach is that it’s small and he hasn’t brought the full brunt of scale to the problem, which is the whole crux of modern ML. I use OP daily. Here is a comment I wrote on a similar thread:

I use it ~90 miles daily and LOVE it. It transforms an ~$18k Civic into a car whose driver assist features are arguably second only to Tesla for a cost of $700.

Limitations: 
1.	Really only useful on the highway, but that's on par with most of the other players right now. 
2.	Depending on the model of car, there are limits to the min speed at which the accel / steering control kick in. My Civic has acceleration control all the way to 0 but steering goes inactive at 13mph. Can be annoying in stop and go traffic. 
3.	Depending on the make and model of car, limitations in vehicle firmware may restrict the total degrees of steering the hijacked lane keep assist can apply to the steering wheel as well as the total amount of torque applied. 
In my commute I have three spots where the limit will be reached and open pilot will ask me to take over.


If you're posting about it, then you probably already know, but I'm going to say this just to be clear. This isn't full self driving and you must continue to pay attention to the road. It does, however, make my drive one in which I sit back and drink my coffee instead of curse at other drivers. I’ve been using this system for over a year in my Lexus RX 450h. I have only enabled it for lateral control of the vehicle, a.k.a. steering, because the system for stop and go in the Lexus by default is already pretty damn good.

Before I bought the Lexus, I owned a Tesla model S, so I have a great deal of experience in two different self driving systems at this point.

My model S was AP2, and there is no doubt that the Tesla is better at self driving at this point. However, there are no other vehicles in production right now that match the capabilities of my Lexus with the comma system other than Tesla. And certainly the Lexus with no self driving is inferior to the Lexus with self driving. 

But I see it for what it is, and aftermarket assistant that makes my highway commuting time much more pleasant. I’m still paying attention, and my hands are near the steering wheel, but I have a great deal of faith that the system will keep the lane very accurately so I can relax a lot more than when I am having to pilot the car directly.

I also recognize that machine learning will require people to participate in order to improve it to the point where it becomes mass market. We are all the early adopters on the curve, and I know that the system I bought isn’t perfect today, and it is unknown when it becomes better than my ability to drive.

But that’s OK. I am participating with a large group of people who are trying to advance scientific progress. And that alone is worth the investment for me.  Not everyone is going to buy a Tesla. But anyone who’s vehicle has the motors required for steering and acceleration and breaking, could potentially use this system to improve the capabilities of their vehicle. And if those people take advantage and purchase the system the roads will become just a little bit safer for everyone. And that’s absolutely worth the investment of time and money. I would suggest that anyone with 2 hours to spare listen to the GeoHotz interview on the Lex Fridman podcast. I'm noticing a lot of criticisms and concerns that, while warranted, are explicitly addressed by George. 

https://youtu.be/iwcYp-XT7UI I have open pilot in my volt and it works great for what it is, essentially filling the major compliant I had and satisfying my want of a Tesla quite a bit (although I still want one)

It is pretty impressive what open pilot can do for only the price of a smartphone, 3d printed holder, and a small amount of time setting it up - and compatible car I travel a ton for work and recently landed a gig within driving distance. I decided to take a break from airports and bought an OP-compatible car. I've logged 12,000 miles in 4 months. So long as you understand what level 2 means, it's an amazing system. I'm always ready to take over and have needed to when the car can't steer itself through sharp corners or if a component of my ACC or LKAS has failed. 

As to the commenter who feared that the system may silently fail, in truth about the exact opposite is what happens. My dashboard goes berserk if it is suddenly unable to communicate with OP. 

George is a little strict when it comes to bringing his vision to reality, but he leaves plenty of room for open source to do its thing. If you don't like the view through George's blinders, you're not forced to get in line behind him. His LinkedIn page is for dating ONLY haha. I love OP, I have about 10k self-driven miles on my Civic. My boy geohotz is as [legit](https://youtu.be/9iUvuaChDEg) as they get. Okay I’ll bite.

Geohot is a hacker, and a hacker is the last thing you want in a system that can kill you. He proved that he is unable to work within the confines of the automotive industry through his encounter with NHTSA, and he continues to rail on companies that he has little visibility into. I can’t speak with authority as to the capabilities of OpenPilot, but it sounds pretty capable from what I hear. However, in automotive, capability is not enough. Functional Safety and rigorous design methodology is really important. What happens when someone puts too much trust in OpenPilot, but a software or hardware problem causes the phone to overheat and fails to warn the driver to take over? He’s offering a 3D printed case around an off the shelf consumer phone with quick turn PCBs that, from what I last heard, are hand assembled. He’s running an operating system that was not designed with safety in mind.

Does it work? Supposedly pretty well. But one day he will kill someone with his system, and someone will lose a loved one and he will blame someone or something else. All because they took his words at face value. It takes more than a good software engineer or even good software skills to develop self driving cars. He probably could make a good engineer or maybe even leader within a larger organization that is taking the right approach. But geohot’s pride and ego prevent him from working well with others. He seems to be frustrated by the lack of speed of innovation in the industry, but sometimes it’s good to be slow and methodical. This is not a one man show, and it’s not winner takes all.

But he won’t listen, because I’m just a “hater”. There seems to be a number of people working on: https://github.com/commaai/openpilot

> openpilot is an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system.

I don't see anything related to machine learning, I could be wrong.

https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/devel/SAFETY.md also is a good read. honestly, he seems like he's using his mild ""hacker"" fame to pump and dump a tech startup.  get some cool tech that actually isn't bad, then pretend his product is going to take over the aftermarket world and that they'll gradually upgrade it to level 3/4 in the future and maybe partner with an automaker. I think the reality is that they're just copying what Mobileye has done and releasing it in a very alpha/beta way, and will never be able to keep up with others in that arena. the way he points to companies like Wamo as ""scammers"" is very telling that his motives are not genuine. that's the impression I get after watching a couple interviews and a talk. Hotz is awesome. That guy is coming for your car insurance. Just gonna warn you now, he's got a massive fan club on Reddit, so take all info here with a very cautious filter.

* ""what even is the market for retirement home shuttles?""
   * uh, you mean buses? huge. sure, there is up-front cost in designing a self driving shuttle bus, but if the sensor suite costs less than $10k, then a fleet of autonomous ford transits will cost roughly half per passenger capacity. so, a city or private bus company can have mini-buses that are 4 times more frequent for the same total capacity, can pull vehicles out of service during off-peak times and still maintain, or could trade that off against more routes. on top of that, it's not considering the possibility that the boring company might actually be able to dig tunnels for less than $80M/mi (hint, they already can). once you have tunnels, it does not make sense to run individual cars through them due to cost per passenger capacity. however, a 16 passenger mini-bus can handle mass-transit but at multiple times the speed.
* ""car ownership is not going down... people like owning cars, for the same reasons people like owning houses"".
   * first, car ownership and house ownership are not at all the same. second, that all depends on cost and time. for the vast majority of people, it's still faster and cheaper to have their own car for most of their transportation. however, I live in a city and it's a constant discussion among people I know of whether to get rid of their cars, because both the cost and time are pretty close to even right now with Uber and Lyft. also, the conversation is more often that they WANT to get rid of their car, but it's *just* too expensive to Uber everywhere; cars are a nuisance to most people who live in cities; a necessary evil. if you can reduce the cost of Uber by half, then if you can get an 80% subsidy like many bus systems get, and you're talking about a dramatic shift in the conversation. on top of that, if you can pool even 2 groups into the same vehicle (potentially not even the same compartment), you can reduce congestion (ohh, by the way, roughly 40-50% of traffic in a city is people looking for parking, which a taxi/mini-bus service would not need to do), reduce pollution, reduce noise, and generally make living in a city better. will that translate to everywhere in the country? no. which is another problem with the presenter's points; he's not considering that different locations will benefit differently from self driving vehicles. he's also not considering the fact that most families have more than 1 car; so having the freedom of a personally owned vehicle can still be there, while the 2nd car (used for commuting) can be replaced while the van for the kids and for road trips can still be there.
* his generic dismissal of redesigning cities around autonomous vehicles. ""the difference, at best, is cost""
   * no. it's a fundamentally different interaction with transportation. I can't say whether or not self driving cars will be prevalent in 20 years. I think so, but who knows. however, IF you make the assumption that self driving taxis can pool two groups, can get city subsidy like a bus, then car ownership will be the exception for many cities. that means a dramatic shift in the way space is used and a dramatic shift in perception of commuting. if you could sell homeowners an extra 6ft in front of their houses in a city because there is no more need for parking, you better believe people will pay for that. if bike infrastructure no longer angers drivers, because only a small percentage of people actually need the parking that will be reduced/eliminated, then that will be a major shift in the equilibrium. lets not even get started again the the Boring Co's possibility to synergize with self driving shuttles, as putting the just a few of the largest thoroughfares below ground would have a huge impact. I think this guy underestimates how quickly things would change if taxiing becomes significantly cheaper. owning a car is a greater piece of a household budget than healthcare, food, student loan debt, and savings. does this guy think healthcare costs being cut in half is not a big deal? does he think student load debt being cut in half isn't a big deal? somebody tell politicians that nobody cares about that \\s.

Yes, I'm being vague intentionally, NDA's are no joke. Good luck getting anyone to give you much info on here... I've worked on projects with many AV companies. Every company is playing the balancing game between fast/ ""innovative"", and slow/safe.

The interesting thing about the SDC industry, is that there's no ""right way"" to do things. These are problems and ideas that have never been thought of before. You can't just reference old material or look in a textbook. Everyone in the industry has ""impostor syndrome"", because it's seriously shooting in the dark.

Unfortunately you're dealing with vehicles and huge risks. Kill someone like Uber did? Your company is out and you ruin the SDC industry for everyone. I'm grateful that the Uber crash wasn't buried because it's started a HUGE reemergence of safety standards in the autonomous industry.

But you can't predict everything. And that makes it scary as hell seeing where people show up on that slow/safe vs. fast/""innovative"" spectrum. I’ve done a few internships in the SDC industry. It’s certainly more interesting work than other companies. 

It’s an exciting industry and I’m happy to work in it but I recently saw a video from Comma.ai’s George Hots where he talked about a lot of the problems with the industry. I’ll link the video if I can find it. Yes. Love it so far. interesting work, fast (but not too fast) pace, extremely intelligent coworkers and great pay. Long term I feel fairly optimistic about company growth. Currently work for one. The best self driving car companies value specialists/researchers and generalists equally. Both skills are very important to making this a reality. (Have you ever worked with PhDs before?)

I recommend you just ask the engineers during the interview process. Yep, work as a vehicle test engineer. What do I do? Everything, since it's a start up. I love the job because I'm my own boss (even though I still have a manager), there's a lot of flexibility and I can use my experiences from other AV companies here. I personally find vehicle testing more exhilarating than SWE because every day is different, and I'm not stuck at a desk! Question for those in these companies:

Is it a low-pressure environment because self-driving engineers are in such high demand and can walk away at any time?

Or is it a high-pressure environment, because people at the top want a working car by 2020-2025?

How are the companies at work/life balance, education, career trajectory? (From the outside they seem pretty startupy)

""...if Tesla ultimately succeeds, it won't be because it's easier to achieve full autonomy without lidar with it. It will simply be because Tesla began large-scale data collection from cameras long before other carmakers."" Lidar is a crutch, but computer vision currently only has one leg. That’s a crappy title.   It’s not like all experts say lidar is a crutch.   Some do, some agree with Elon. One question I have is:

If you have LIDAR in a full self-driving vehicle as well as cameras, what components could fail (due to weather, duct tape from a nefarious person, etc) and still allow the vehicle to continue being capable of full self driving?

Also, is it a popular theory that full self driving is only possible with all these types of sensors functional together?  (requiring full redundancy) Could it be possible that once the cost of lidar falls, that tesla could find it difficult to make use of the data, having not trained with it?  Or would it be as simple as swapping it into the calculation at the point where the NN normally simulates a lidar style point cloud?  In other words could tesla have a lidar data disadvantage?

Could fsd teslas being sold today be retrofitted with solid state lidar? Shouldn't Elon release his own self driving car before he gets on his high horse. That's what I've been saying all along as a vehicle test and SW engineer working on self-driving cars... great to know the obvious. I hate this question. I feel like sensor choice is really a value engineering question. 

We first need to answer the question, is creating a safe enough FSD car possible?

The second question of if can we make it cheaper, is just secondary. Reading this thread made me think that some people think more is better by definition. As in more sensors! More redundancy! Lidar! Radar! Cameras!

But I would argue that it's actually the opposite. The less inputs you have into your system (obviously keeping backup sensors to validate against sensor failures), the simpler and easier it is to develop.

Elon is dead right to say that we do have an example of an extremely successful implementation of vision based guidance system honed over millenia. Our eyes and a very powerful neural net.

Adding lidar, or radar for that matter, is making it unnecessarily complicated. The basic issue will be priority. Let's say you drive on the street at there's a vertical object on the side of the road. Camera thinks it's a person, lidar thinks it's might be a pole. Who is right? Who do you pick? 

My point is going with different types of overlapping sensors will only result in more complex system, not a better one. Had a great guest lecturer come in talking about lidar systems in geotechnical analysis of river beds etc. Also 3D construction site scanning more relevant to us civils & how you can check your Revit drawings to a real building. Even disease spread analysis based on an old buildings 3D model. Great stuff. $250,000 price tag. 

Not the stuff you'd want on a car. Like everyone always mentions here the data storage alone is hilariously stupid and not something you process locally. Also traffic signs, arrows are flat. Traffic lights use colour to communicate. No one is gonna go out and retro fit a billion road signs to be lidar compatible.

LIDAR without cameras is not feasible from an engineering standpoint alone, let alone monetary.",Elon Musk: “Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.” Experts: Maybe not

Let's see one actually get released Mercedes: like any of them, could get delayed or cancelled.  But I do think it will launch in 2020..... however the volume they are expecting is less than 1000 units. And it will only be sold in Cali, and it will also only work in traffic jams with following vehicles, and also only work on certain divides freeways...... And, those certain divides freeway will Only be in the state of Cali for the first years.   All that said, I think it is possible that Mercedes ends up being first to market in 2020

BMW:   Sounds like this will end up just being another L2+ system, because BMW is behind on robust enough electronic vehicle architecture.  Will also be limited to certain divided freeways, at first only in a few locations in US.

Audi:  still waiting for it to be activated in Germany, however that may not happen, and seems like Audi’s consumer self driving car team is gone.

Tesla:  no L3 product in line of sight, and doesn’t seem they are concerned with building something like that. Just a friendly reminder that BMW partnered with, and will be using, Innoviz’s solid state lidar on the 2021 3er. Who are MB’s suppliers? We know Audi and BMW have partnerships with Mobileye, but they also have partnerships with other players too. I guess what I’m wondering is, very few companies have a cohesive plan involving their own software and hardware engineers (Tesla, Mobileye, Waymo) most are relying on a patchwork of tier 1 suppliers and they’re own internal people too. This is why for level 2 we see such a broad variety of implementation (from Volvo to caddy’s Super Cruise) all using the same chip, but some companies are doing more on top of it.  


I’m assuming that BMW’s promised L3 is from mobileye and continental. Audi’s will probably be from one of their other partnerships. MB is a toss up. Hyped marketing and PR stunt. Is it confirmed that ""the C-class will be adopting the technology later in the year""? Is it level 3 on **ALL** roads or just on a few, pre-mapped roads?

One is insanely impressive and would put them ahead of Waymo, Tesla, and Cruise. The other would be quite... luke warm at best. Let's hope their marketing is a little more cautious than Tesla's.

Then again, nothing is more responsible than calling your L1.5 system ""autopilot"" and showing videos of the company CEO and employees driving with no hands.","Mercedes Benz first to market Level 3 autonomy?

So we actually have a driverless taxi service on public roads now. Are these rides cheaper than an Uber or Lyft? >  He says it's usually about three minutes and rarely longer than five.  

This is impressive given that this is still very much a testing project.  Sure, it sounds like there is a 2:1 Waymo One customer to car ratio and most of them are not using it full time.  That said, I would imagine that wait times would only get better as the network is able to expand with more customers.  I still expect certain times to have longer wait times but that should only be a few times per day at most and even then we might see fleets lean toward more capacity rather than trying to keep fleet counts as small as possible, especially while they are charging above $0.50/mile.

Thoughts?",SelfDrivingCars,RFID tags in road reflectors?,0," Here’s a good rule of thumb for all of your future thoughts and idea in terms of self driving:

If it requires an infrastructure revamp at a mass scale, it’s likely not a good idea and will never happen. The reason being cost. Infrastructure changes are insanely expensive and there’s almost always a better alternative.

Even something as simple as repainting lane lines to make it easier for self driving cars is not possible. I don't see the need, is GPS not good enough? Road reflectors aren't used in the north because the snow plows scrape them off. Rural areas.  
SDC's will need the ability to locate based on maps and signs.  
The cellular network could also provide this information. I would guess it is cheaper to send up a new GPS satellite network than equipping and maintaining all world road deflectors with rfid tags. >Cars could have readers and a simple database with the RFID locations.

How do you prevent me from crowbarring your RFID tags and glueing them back down in a line going off a cliff a-la Wile E Coyote? There are existing autonomy solutions which do this, although the tags are embedded into the road. As you would guess, these autonomy systems are only designed to be used in a relatively small, well defined area. It is a good alternative when you are in a GPS denied environment, or when your surroundings are too dynamic for lidar based localization. It is much cheaper as well, although you can still use lidar for obstacle detection.

There is also the wire guided approach, where a wire, rather than RFID tags is embedded into the road. An inductive sensor can locate the wire. Other than in tunnels don't see the point.  GPS works great and is only going to get better with GPS III once that goes live. Why would you not use GPS? They are one of the cheapest options to use when it comes to localization. This is basically how CBTC works in metro train systems. It's expensive, not in the actual tags but in the labor to put them on hundreds of miles of track and survey their locations accurately.","RFID tags in road reflectors?

It may be desirable to build good cruise control, but why? What's the point of a product where you have to pay attention 100% of the time and it only works on 'good' roads like divided highways? It's hard to take him seriously when his first point was so completely disingenuous.  He starts out with ride sharing is a small percentage of rides, which is true.  His next point is that L4 ride sharing is a worse product than Uber/Lyft because the service area is smaller, slower and more expensive.  Therefore L4 ride sharing is going to take a product that is a small percentage of rides and make it worse.

This is such a false equivalence and George is smart so he is doing it on purpose.  

Uber/Lyft have 2% of the rides in the US.  The reason they are such a low number is because the price the market is willing to pay for rides means the pool of drivers willing to drive is pretty limited.  This has a feedback effect which also makes the time to get a ride higher.  If drivers were willing to take $1/mile you would see 10x more drivers and they would probably capture 20% of rides in the US.  

More importantly, drivers aren't equivalent to AI.  A driver isn't going to wait around for an hour just to capture a 10 mile ride at 2am where an AI has nothing better to do and costs $0 additional dollars to wait in a parking lot in suburbia or in the garage.

The less service area is just completely false.  Both Uber and Lyft have service areas.  Why their service area in Phoenix is larger than Waymo's, there is no reason to believe that Waymo couldn't expand to match the area covered or even expand beyond it.

Slower is a real problem.  I'm not sure how big of an impact this has, but it will have some for sure.  I have repeatedly spoken out about this problem and believe that SDCs have to be able to ignore traffic laws to drive more like humans which will be safer.

The more expensive argument is just false and completely misleading.  First he quotes $300k to $500k per vehicle.  Even if Waymo did or is paying this much per car, it isn't going to stay that way very long as prices come down.  That said, he throws in another false equivalence when he compares this cost to an Uber Driver saying ""Uber Drivers"" are making that much without comparing the productivity they are doing.  Just like factories buy a robot for $1m to replace a worker that was making $60k, that doesn't mean it's not a huge cost savings.  The robot can work 24/7/365 and never makes a costly mistake, takes less management overhead and lasts for 10 years.  Same with an SDC that can drive 250 miles/day 7 days a week 365 days a year.  At the current ride sharing cost of $2/mile this is $180k/year.  Return on investment is 3 years even at a $500k capital cost.  However, if the car only costs $100k you make $80k on the car the first year.  That is a lot better than the current ride sharing companies are doing per driver which is losing about $10k. All you people are downvoting this without actually watching it.

Really good talk which a lot of realism in there. IF you watched that video then you should definitely watch this video where he comes clean.

Cruise's social media hashtag is #Supercruise so I'm fairly confident they have no idea how to use and market their brand. I regularly rent cars. GMs are some of the worst; no; correct that; they are perfectly tied with Chrysler for the worst rentals possible. Nearly anything can be wrong with them, from terrible design, fit and finish, gas consumption, etc. 

Take a GMC pickup truck. I will get one that has a measured gas consumption. Then I will get a ford truck (I don't think ford is all that good either) of the same size that has an EPA consumption that is similar. Yet the ford will literally get double the millage when I am done. Double. I suspect the Ford truck is efficient for normal usage, whereas the GMC is efficient only for the EPA tests; that is they literally built the truck for the test not for consumers. 

Everything about the GM products suck technology-wise. Backup sensors, backup cameras, syncing my phone (ford is crap at this too), they can't even get rear-view mirrors right most of the time. What the poop were they thinking with that knob turning gearshift? Why not move the turn indicator down by the seat adjustment knobs?

How on earth are they going to get self driving, one of the hardest problems in cars today, even halfway right?

What I see here are executives who don't actually give a crap about driverless cars. What they are hoping is that their people get a handful of patents so the company that does get it right has to cross license instead of just murdering them with a complete portfolio of patents. Also, the board is probably asking, ""What are you doing in the self-driving space?"" and the CEO doesn't want to say, ""Look we have barely cracked the 1980's in tech; so nothing.""

I'm not joking when I say that I judge people who buy GM products. If you bought a G6 then you are, let's say, unwise.

The car is a robot.  It can position itself precisely, especially if you give it some targets to see with its cameras in the charging station.   So you don't need a big expensive multi-degree of freedom robot arm to plug it in.   In fact, if you start thinking about it in the car, you just want a small box it drives over and pins or plates to connect under the car.

But even with existing charging port, like on the Tesla, the ""robot"" to plug in the cord needs just one actuator to go in and out, plus perhaps another for height.   J1772 does need something that can press the latch lever to release it.   European style is more difficult since the standard type 2 plug goes on the charging station not the car.

But stations where robots can plug in are a good idea to work with, just this is an expensive way to do it. I imagine they understand your point, but need to attract customers which may not know which vehicles they are going to use yet.

By building a complex we-can-charge-anything machine, they are proving that they understand how to build any custom solution.

>Navya (formerly Navia) was the real pioneer of the robocar business,  over 5 years ago they started actually selling their low speed shuttles,  with no brakes or steering wheel, for campus use.   They've been doing a  lot of experiments since then as a ""last mile"" shuttle as well.   But  they announced this week they don't think they will get regulatory  approval any time soon -- their shuttles still run with a human monitor  with a kill switch -- and will get out of trying to sell physical  shuttles and into selling the design and software stack.  
>  
>In this new article, I talk about this and examine the question of  whether autonomous shuttles on fixed routes, especially ""last mile to  transit"" shuttles, where ever a good idea.   They just eliminate a  driver and save some money, and they don't even save money yet. Too bad for Navya.  I think they were certainly an innovator and I think they largely got the design of the SDC right.  In 10 years I think what you see moving people around cities will look a lot like the Navya shuttle.  I get that building the shuttle is just too cost prohibitive, but I'm not sure how much luck they will have licensing the software given that what they are doing isn't that difficult and it was the combination of hardware and software that was their main competitive leverage.  Their main mistake was founding in Europe which will quickly crush any tech company with regulation.

> A bigger question is just how good an idea shuttles, in particular ""last mile"" shuttles are. 

While I completely agree with Brad about not looking at SDCs as solutions for 19th century problems, I'm not sure I buy that shuttles are a bad idea.  They really aren't much bigger than a car at all.  The current downside is how slow they are, but this is more of a regulation and saftey issue than some defining feature of the vehicle type.  

I agree with his point that removing the driver from larger vehicles like planes and trains doesn't affect the cost in any noticeable way.  However, it's Brad that is comparing cars to horses and saying hay isn't expensive.  Removing the driver from a six car commuter train doesn't save much money, but automating the train allows you to run each car as it's own train and massively increase the quality of service the same set of tracks can deliver with no increase in cost.  Same for buses where the size of the bus is dictated by the small number of drivers you can afford.  Take the driver out of the calculus and the optimal bus size becomes 15-20 passenger rather than 54-72.","Pioneer Navya Pulls Back From Building Robo-Shuttles, But Were They Ever A Good Idea? "

This area of game theory is pretty well understood.   What you need is a way to recognize the other cars.  You could recognize their licence plates of course (if they have one on the front) but you can also just recognize the make and model, because all of a given model will use the same software.

Then you follow the ""tit for tat"" strategy.  If a vehicle plays nice, you play nice.  Once a vehicle starts playing selfish, you also play selfish.  It becomes very stupid to play selfish, and soon everybody plays nice.

In this case, the cars actually have a lovely and perfect calculation of who should back up, if backing up is needed.  (It's actually rare -- the better option is that the cars adjust their speeds so that they will meet at a wide spot.)

if a car is playing nice, it selects the solution which is obviously optimum for both.   If that's backing up, it does it.  If it goes forward when the optimum solution is for it to back up, then both cars get stuck for a while until some fallback happens.  But even if the nice car, after waiting a while, backs up, the defecting car has already lost -- it is finding itself worse off than if it had backed up.   The more it defects, the more other cars make it wait longer.

No V2V needed here.  A little bit of V2Cloud can help, in that cars which decide to travel down narrow roads can publish their planned trajectory, and other cars can do the same and again, they can naturally adjust speeds to meet at the wide point, where everybody wins.   They don't even have to come to an agreement.  Anybody who doesn't do the optimal thing soon gets a strong incentive to do so. I guess I'm glad people are thinking about this, but I'm not sure this is a real problem until way into the scale out of SDCs.  If you met an SDC on such a road today, the fact that it was an SDC would inform the negotiation and the manual car would resolve it.

Longer term the problem might not even exist.  Completely outside of SDCs, there is a huge parking problem in cities, even cities are car unfriendly as NYC.  The streets are owned by the city yet a huge percentage of the parking spots are unmetered. The cities want to remove the parking or meter them but political constraints keep them in check currently.  As ride sharing scales as autonomous cars are able to increase the number and cost of cars in the fleets, cities will have an easier time removing these spots which will mostly be occupied by the more wealthy as less wealthy citizens go from two-car families to one-car and then zero-car families.

Even longer term we might see a reversal in the trend from taking one-way streets and making them two-way back to one-way streets.  SDCs don't have problems figuring out how to snake through the city on one-way streets like humans do.  This will reduce the size of the street needed and reclaim the streets for transportation both on foot and in cars and banish the parking lots our city streets have become. This is actually the main benefit to SDCs in my mind.

Invididuals are out there playing one-off games of prisoner's dilemma, so they are defecting on each other.

When the game theory is hard coded into the car by a company, it's something you can legislate and/or shame the companies for. Instead of millions of interactions between millions of spontaneous, anonymous, untraceable agents, you'll have millions of interactions between what boils down to a few dozen agents copied and pasted, all traceable, deterministic, and programmable.

People are going to be shocked how much of the gains in SDCs come from traffic suddenly just becoming smooth as people stop constantly trying to switch lanes and creating traffic jams for the fear of being the ""loser in the lane that isn't currently moving""",Can AI 'virtually bargain' to negotiate traffic?

We need self-driving testing regulations first, before we even reach the legislation portion of it. We're so hell-bent on the end result we haven't even made regulations effective in all 50 states for testing. As it stands, each state has their own authority to write the rules for testing. Take, for example, the very liberal legislation of self-driving in places like Arizona, Detroit, and Florida. The problem is that our leaders are clueless on tech (just watch Congress interviewing Zuckerberg if you don't believe me), and that's why I think they're hesitant on passing legislation, because they have no clue how any of this tech works, what the criteria for safety are, how to quantify safety in autonomous vehicles, etc. > lobbying on driverless cars dropped 35 percent between the end of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.

Level 4 ranges from a Telsa geofenced to a parking lot (summons mode) to a full scale national rollout of waymo one without safety drivers.  If that waymo doesnt work on muddy dirt roads, in heavy snow, etc it is not a level 5.  No one is shooting for a level 5 car at this point.   True level 5 is probably needs a breakthrough in AI - something close to Artificial General intelligence.   There is no way to know when a breakthrough will occur but it could take decades or centuries.  

What we really want is a level 4 that works in nearly all driving conditions, on nearly all roads with no need for a safety driver backup.

Would love to understand, anyone know?",SelfDrivingCars,What is being tested in open world testing?,1," Sensors themselves are rarely tested on the vehicle during real-world driving miles, they are often tested in isolation from the rest of the system. Sensor models (software) can be validated by comparing them to their real-life counterparts.

However, to more directly answer your question, the “testing” piece of open-world testing happens (for the most part) offline. The vehicles are driven either autonomously or not, and all of their sensor info, as well as the I/O from each distributed software system including the DBW outputs is logged. After the drive, this data, sometimes 10s-100s of TB, is transferred to a copy center and then to a storage location that’s easily accessible. Engineers/Developers will often “play back” that data into a software-based version of the cars AV stack and analyze the decisions made. They can even manipulate the data to create additional scenarios or inject faults. Statistics and analysis can be done on the recorded data without playing it back too. It sounds like your question is related to sensor characterization, which generally isn't directly tested anymore at the vehicle test drive stage. By that point, the sensor characteristics should be well understood and modeled. Mostly at this point the engineers are evaluating their perception algorithms, which converts sensor signals into things like objects with certain attributes (pedestrian moving at 5mph with this heading). Communication issues (latency, frame drops) or calibration issues (occlusion, positioning, etc) can still occur and will be usually monitored on the vehicle level as well.","What is being tested in open world testing?

There are some interesting concepts for perceptive aids in AR glasses, but i haven't seen them executed well.

https://youtu.be/5R1snVxGNVs Not really.  The basic problem is that majority of all input nerves into the human brain are from the eyes.  It's where all the bandwidth is.  Also, automotive grade sensors meant for autonomous cars are actually quite large, heavy, and power heavy, and will remain that way as the tech advances.  

&#x200B;

The actual fix for this is a solution to the actual problem, whether that be a brain implant that bypasses the eyes and optic nerves completely, or just some really clever glasses to get around dead spots in a person's vision. There are some products, while I don't think they use LIDAR, do something similar. For example, the [Sunu Band](https://www.sunu.com/en/index.html)

I think the bigger issue is how to communicate the info back to the user. Vibration can only go so far, and I'm not sure that something like LIDAR would really be beneficial. Highly unlikely to be useful  due to the delay in sensing, translating, interpreting, processing and reacting. Right now these companies are guarding this work pretty closely. Once it gets out I think that the sensor fusion and the neural nets needed to fuse them in real time will be applicable to other fields.

So many billions are going into this right now to win that particular race to level 4 but like all tech with that much investment it will inevitably spill to other fields when it becomes widely adopted.","Can autonomous car navigation be translated for human uses?

Even with the latest 1.12 update though, the raw returns are still nosier than Velodyne data, and do not handle extremely high or low reflectivity scenarios as well as Velodynes do.

But in the other 95 percent of scenarios, the Ousters' performance is more than enough, and for the price - I cannot complain. I'm looking forwards to the OS2. Little Rover looks like ClapTrap from borderlands What model is postmates going to use ?

As well it will complain if hands are removed and will disable EAP if ignored. Not clear that there is basis to this suit. An airplane's autopilot works similarly. It can maneuver on a plotted course under its own power. However, a pilot must be observing and ready to take over at all times. This is standing protocol for all aircraft equipped with an autopilot device. So if it's good enough to fly hundreds of millions of people a year, then why isn't it good enough to drive a few million people around? It seems like the thing they don't like about it is what the name implies rather then issues with it's functionality:

I honestly can't believe that they'd take an issue with Auto-Pilot over it's name, but NOT with how Tesla sells 'Full Self-Driving' that isn't fully developed or deployed yet. You'd think they'd have a stronger argument in shifting literally all of these points over to the 'Full Self-Driving' functionality that isn't full self driving as of yet.

I  feel most of the vocal posters on this sub don't agree with a statement like this.  Getting there faster is good but the goal is hugely important. All of these cars look like they are being driven by toddlers. Even the best demo I've seen has been easily thrown off by the smallest thing. Further, why they fail isn't always clear.

If they try and turn these cars loose in cities people are going to die left and right. I'm happy so many smart people are working on this and I think it's one of the biggest tech challenges that humans have ever taken on. I think it's not all that far off from putting a man on the moon (full level 5 I mean).

I don't think it's clear yet if any of the companies shooting for this can deal with the tail yet. They could very easily make sharp progress to a certain point then get completely stuck. [removed] [removed]",GM's Cruise Delays Robot-Taxi Service

524,,1564032779.0,1564003979.0,/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/chedbo/newbie_speculative_questions_about_selfdriving/,"Hi everyone, 

I have become interested in self-driving cars and figured you guys could help me answer some questions. These are based around personal interest, such as what will it be like in the future, as my driving is so so:

(a) I see quite various dates about when we will see self-driving cars; what is your informed opinion about when it will commonplace? Say in Western countries.

(b) Do you think at some point there will just be self-driving cars and no ""normal cars? 

(c) Will drivers need to be able to drive themselves? This seems an overlooked issue to me, one of the obvious benefits of self-driving is people who can't drive (disabled, old, etc.) could have their own car. I never see this discussed!

I know these are very basic, but hopefully interesting!",SelfDrivingCars,Newbie speculative questions about self-driving cars,2," (a) Think in terms of **cities** in Western countries, not entire countries. The roll-out will happen in cities where it is easiest to deploy (Waymo claims 5 years away from multiple cities IIRC). If you want an answer for every marked road in the US, I'd say 25-40 years. Longer in Europe (from anecdotal evidence that roads tend to be a bit smaller and more tricky to navigate in smaller areas)

&#x200B;

(b) Not in our lifetime, but I do think we'll see roads built for only SDC's to increase traffic efficiency. There will always be tech-averse people, people who view driving as both a right and a hobby, and people who are extreme adrenaline junkies. I do envision harder crackdowns on reckless driving violations as roads become safer and safer.

&#x200B;

(c) The first self-driving car ride was actually taken by a blind man in Texas. Alphabet has always underscored accessibility as one of their prime directives, many are very aware of how it will blow open social environments to those who were limited by their ability to get around, but since it's not available to any of us yet, we are primarily focused on when we'll be able to use it :) a) depends what you mean by self-driving cars.  Cars that can self drive for a period on a lane marked highway are here now.  Cars that can self-drive anywhere, including into rural areas, are many many years away.  Expect to see more systems to take over driving in certain areas and conditions but most vehicles will still have facilities for a human driver.   

b) Does not need to be one or the other.  Human drivable cars will still use self-drive safety systems.  A little like automatic braking in current cars.  The human may drive when required, for example onto a construction site,  but with inbuilt safety systems.

c) More likely old and disabled will use automatic taxi fleets, a little like the disabled or old using Uber or a taxi now. >(a)  

Just like any complex future predictions with lot of variables, you can't really get away from a wide range of possible dates.  Part of the problem isn't just that it's a complex thing to predict but also there are many definitions of what ""when will we see self-driving cars"" means. To simplify it some I would define it as self driving taxi fleets with no saftey driver in most top 10 metros.  I know the ""most"" is a hedge, but NYC is such a crap shoot because of politics I feel you have to add this qualification and it's not a tech hedge.

In the past few weeks, most of the ""2020 and 2021"" companies have pretty much admitted they aren't going to make it.  Tesla is the only company left still claiming they will be ready in the next two years.  My personal opinion is they got caught out right before everyone pulled back and now are left holding a bag they can't deliver.

This middle dates of ~2025 have always been the smart money but this has mostly been pushed by independent futurists and not companies that are building the tech and have to convince investors and poach talent from other companies.  I'm in this camp still, but ask me again in 2023 and I might be singing a different tune.

The conservative estimate is ""by 2030"".  This group is feeling better about themselves with each passing delay in in the aggressive group.  There is also some crossover from the middle group depending on how you define the requirements of self-driving is here.

> (b)

Eventually maybe but as far out as I am comfortable with I think there will always be at least cars that can be driving manually.  Even just the end of manual only cars is very far out.  I can't see why you wouldn't have manual control of some cars forever.

> (c)

Not sure I understand the question.  There will be 3 classes of vehicles.  Full autonomous with no manual control, autonomous cars with the option for manual control and fully manual vehicles.  This is in the next 20-30 years.  After that I'm not sure manual only cars will be much needed but I see the ability to control an autonomous car manually being needed for a long time if for no other reason that it's easy to do and there are no downsides.","Newbie speculative questions about self-driving cars Hi everyone,

As someone that had a stroke and isn't capable of driving himself around because my cognitive abilities are too damaged, this isn't good for my (already broken) mental health. I can respect articles that have a bleak outlook on the future of SDCs if they simply relay information impassively, but the tone of articles along these lines is often smug and borders on taunting. It's great that people who don't have stakes in this matter either way, who can just hop in a car and go wherever they want whenever they want, can laugh at an industry running into some trouble - but for some of us that are disabled, and alternate between guilt over being a burden to their loved ones and terror at wondering how they'll get by if they ever find themselves in a position where nobody will help them... it doesn't feel good to have people gloat over the potential failure of something that is an important source of hope for us (and that's something which is beyond rampant here on this subreddit, where seemingly 90 percent of the posters here are either skeptical of the technology or against it outright). A robust public transport system would make this *much* less relevant of an issue, but America isn't known for its public transportation.

So, is there anyone out there (whether companies or random redditors) who think that self-driving cars actually have a bright future, and that said future will arrive at a reasonably decent speed? I hope this is just a hideously fucking horrible trough, and that we look back at 2018 and 2019 and think ""we really were excessively pessimistic"" like with all those people during the 1990s and very early 2000s who thought the internet was a failure because it took a few years to take off.",SelfDrivingCars,Is there ANYONE optimistic about self-driving cars anymore?,118," Definitely. What's happened is that autonomous driving is past the peak of inflated expectations and has moved into the trough of disillusionment. 

Take a look at Gartner's hype cycle for 2018, and in particular level 4 autonomous driving:

But the hard work continues to occur, and bit by bit it should climb out of the trough of disillusionment as the technology is refined and deployed in more and more complex scenarios.

I have no idea how long it will take, but Waymo is certainly acting like it's not going to take decades, as they are continuing to invest in areas that would only be necessary if they plan to scale in the relatively near future. That gives me hope that we'll start to see real progress with their real world deployments within the next 3 years. Don't worry, sdcs are inevitable. Some \*cough\* Elon Musk \*cough\* are just promising too much too often. But we will get there one day. This gloomy period is common for any major development. Now all the hard work needs to be done. Once the hard work is done then we will have self driving cars. Hard work like this is not done overnight. Probably 5-10 years from now it will be commonplace. The cycle of all major developments is the same. This gloomy period is predicted before it occurred. I am happy to get a car that does lane holding and following.

Self driving sounds great, but I don’t actually expect it yet. [removed] Yes soon, although ""soon"" is still years. but not many so....soon.
i too am anxiously awaiting their arrival.
 i can no longer drive and my wife will have to stop soon...... Of course they'll happen and we haven't thought of all the million of ways they'll help. Situations like yours are perfect and life changing.

The only question is when.

It sounds like you're close to obsessing about the subject - and I totally understand why. You really, REALLY want the benefits of personal mobility again. I'd be exactly the same in your position.

But - they won't be here tomorrow, nor the next day. Several years off. Understand that media loves to shock and complain and exaggerate everything - they have to compete in a saturated market. Be cynical of things you read and, if you can, take a step back to get some wider perspective. 

They may not be ready in time to be useful to you. Adapt to that, accept the alternatives. When it comes, there's no way you won't know.

Wild idea though: Approach SDC companies and explain your position. They might, just might, want to work with you for extended testing. Likelyhood is slim, but it may help you focus more on the positive sides of this. The gloomy period is the reaction of people coming to term with the timeline being longer than they thought. The company most likely to get there first is waymo. OP you mentioned you live in a rural area, i think you need to steel yourself that it's going to be a while before they expand to where you are. **Doubly** so if you live somewhere where it snows in the winter as that is a huge challenge right now. 

&#x200B;

I do think that once google feels that Tempe, AZ is ""solved"", and they demonstrate very low accident rates with no safety drivers, they will expand relatively quickly in regions with similar climates (New Mexico, SoCal etc). However, they haven't solved Tempe yet - if they didn't have safety drivers today the vehicles would likely perform worse than human drivers in several respects. Second, if you live anywhere with real weather that's a whole other can of worms. I think expanding outside of Phoenix for Waymo is at least 3 years away, and could easily be more.

&#x200B;

Finally, if ""robotaxis"" do come first (which i think is likely because it allows the company to control where they go) I think you have to temper your expectations with regards to the effects. They probably still won't be available in rural areas. And the cost reduction that people think it will be is overblown - the main cost of operating the taxi service will still be idle drive time, gas and car maintenance - not the driver.

&#x200B;

I don't mean to come out as negative - i love self driving car technology and i think it's awesome. I hope it comes out ASAP. But I also don't feel like pretending it's at a place where it's not. So what you see as negativity is just me being realistic. I think [AI Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) are pretty common. AI is such a tantalising goal that when there are noises about what might be possible people massively over hype them. I think were in an AI autumn right now, sure new results are still coming but they're mostly just bigger and better NeuralNetworks's and not really anything new. 

I worked for an SDC company for a bit and I think for SDC's what Tesla can do with it's new hardware is an interesting question. Their new computer is 21x more powerful than the old one I believe and they haven't pushed it to it's limit yet. 

However robotics is easier 1. where explosions are acceptable (like mines, the bottom of the sea or Mars) and 2. where the task to be performed is very repetitive (such as a welding robot in a factory that only needs to do one weld forever). This is why SDC's are stalling, because they are hard on both of these factors. 

I wouldn't want to make any long term predictions until I see what Tesla can do this year. I am because I see the future:

Everyone's car self drives, and they can communicate with each other in order to ensure safety in the local area. There will be privately owned roadways for driving your own car if you like to do that, but most public roadways will be devoted to self-driving car algorithms for efficiency and safety. I'm optimistic, and I'm very impressed with what driving assist programs can do today.

But, at the same time, it's important to recognize that predictions by Tesla and Waymo have been so wrong in the past that it's hard to conclude anything but that they overestimated how easy it would be to move much beyond L2. 

Right now, I'm interested in seeing how the tech progresses, but I fundamentally distrust any prediction about when we will actually have SDCs. 

Once (or if) Waymos with a safety driver become rare, I might revisit that. I think current articles may be hostile because people usually don't take very kindly to promises being broken. But realistically you have to remember the sensationalization that occurs in journalism. That happens in the older articles that overly hype up SDCs as well as the recent articles that try to dramatically break them down.

The truth is this technology takes time. It's easy to be positive now if you never let yourself fall into the hype train to begin with. SDCs are just as likely to happen as they ever were, but now we have all the uninformed people saying they'll be here tomorrow finally shut down. Do you need to be optimistic though? I'd prefer realistic. And excited too!

I was downvoted to hell around here 2-3 years ago when I tried to point out that the promises are impossible. Turns out even I was too optimistic about the prospects. Personally owned universally capable self-driving vehicles are very, very far away (there's no point making exact date prediction or promise - no one knows and definitions are vague anyways). But small closed environment low-speed automation (airports, campuses, parks) is here, limited highway automation and limited, geofenced, fleet-owned ""taxi"" services are arriving within the next few years. I think the industry has a bright future and this tech will arrive within our lives.

That being said, I'd also like to see lot more focus on mass transit automation. In my experience, they operate on smaller margins (buses) and the rolling stock is only replaced every 20 years or so (trains) so there is a bit less incentive there for now. But will be more in a couple years.

But also let's not forget this is not a binary thing: self-driving or not! The media buzz and this sub tends to approach this from the tech-y startup-y direction that promises groundbreaking disruption, new technology, yada yada. For auto manufacturers, this is just evolution. Incremental changes are important because they are happening right now. Every year every new model introduces new convenience and safety features. Some of these do save lives as we speak! We don't necessarily need to wait for this magical technology 10 years from now to make transportation better and safer. I’m optimistic. My background is transforming data into dollars, especially in high-quality manufacturing.

Tesla, Mobileye and Waymo are delivering SDCs right now. We’re just in the trough of disillusionment where any setback in the system feels like doom and gloom for autonomy entirely.

We already have Level 4 robotaxis in limited environments. So it’s obvious that we will have L4 robotaxis in more places soon.

“Level 3 with remote assistance” will be a viable business. We will need to solve the bulk of SDC to get there, but the bulk of SDC is already being conquered by Waymo, Tesla and Mobileye.

So ignore the discussion around Level 5 and true autonomy. The world will change long before we reach Level 5. Whenever a new technology matures to the point of entering the public consciousness there's a rush of enthusiasm followed by a whiplash of disappointment when the goods don't materialize after two years. Look at the Human Genome Project, basically had no effect for the next 10 years on anything. Now it's hard to imagine it not having happened and we take it totally for granted. 

At the end of the day, the technical problems are hard, but there winner in this race stands to make many billions of dollars. My bet is 2023ish. [deleted] [The ARGO AI CEO does very confidently](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/videos-and-footage/ford-and-vw-cooperation-statement-bryan-salesky-3425) It’s just a matter of when not if. SDCs are coming no matter what anyone says, it’s just not as easy as everyone thought it would be and is taking some time. 

There’s why too much potential upside for anyone to give up on it. Plus as tech progresses it’s going to be more and more of a possible future for them. Sure.

5 years ago I was saying ""20 years away, but it'll be great"". 

Now people are coming back up to me being like ""you were excited for SDCs right? Bet you feel dumb now that they're still not ready!"", and I'm just lost for words. If anything I feel like I was overly conservative. 

Human drivers are not going to get any better. SDCs continue to get better for cheaper. A gradually rising line is going to intersect a horizontal one at some point. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle

They will arrive but it may take longer than people thought during the height of the hype phase. I don’t plan to buy a new car until they are A to B automated, at least for highway travel. I’m very optimistic this will happen within 10 years. There are over 80+ companies working on self driving car projects... We are in the trough of disillusionment phase right now. Slope of enlightenment incoming. I've been working/thinking about self driving cars off and on since that DARPA challenge in 2004.

Yesterday I came up with a new, basic idea, having to do with autonomous vehicle safety that is not obvious.

I am very optimistic about the entire industry. People are realizing SDCs will take a bit longer than they realized as it's a hard problem but with the amount of money invested and companies working on it its pretty inevitable. Even once they start appearing on the roads commercially it will take a while for them to spread across the country and into different markets. The current state of autonomous cars reminds me of the hype around electric cars in 2007-2012. The Leaf was incoming so too the Roadster as well as a trickle of terrible CA compliance cars. And automakers has lots of vague words and cool prototypes being shown with timelines that turned into smoke. But it turned out to be a big nothing burger for another 5-10 years and only now (2020) are we actually seeing a sizable number of entrants into the market with a variety of features, packaging, platforms, and capabilities such that it will reach more than the dedicated librarian crowd. 

I think around 2030 we’ll see 1-2 serious entries and several automakers will have their first real cars (which they will market as their 2nd/3rd generation products.) There is money to be made. There is so much money being invested right now. That isn't going to slow down. Small Successes isn't news.  It doesn't make good headlines for incremental successes.

But failures do make for good news Reality is setting in for automakers. As someone who is part of the SDC development ,our company isnt stopping at all , we for sure look at the mishaps happening around and making corrective measures from our side as well but we aint stopping ??? Has something changed? Progress still being made by dozens of companies with the release of the cars in 20s-21s. Useless OP It's not a question of if, we just haven't nailed the when yet.  Less than a decade is near certain IMO. This will get buried, but keep an eye on [www.gh.st](https://www.gh.st) over the next year. You don't need self-driving for affordable mobility. 

Shared on-demand minibuses or SUV's are one good solution - see ridewithvia.com . And much of what they're doing happens in the US.

And I think transportation authorities are becoming more open to innovation, so that's good too.

And a simplified form of self-driving , say just in highways , could play a part in that too. In the meantime you could move to Mexico like me.  Short Uber trips cost me less than $2.

I am very optimistic of the possibility of Waymo or Tesla moving to a next stage later this year or next.  I also think there is a strong possibility of Tesla having some bad crashes at their next stage.  Which I will still be optimistic because that will be three crashes compared to thousands by humans.

I think actually the main reason to look forward to deployment of self driving cars is not disabled accessibility, although that is one aspect.  By far the biggest reason is the massive reduction in injury, property damage, and death that wide deployment of self driving cars will bring.

There are a lot of ignorant haters.  Just remember that most people have very little knowledge of any recent developments of anything, and almost no ability to judge anything on its merits.  Almost all opinions are based on pre-existing outdated worldviews rather than actual thought. People thought this would be a sprint. They are now preparing for a marathon. Solving one damned problem after the other. And then there will be a tipping point when all this quantity becomes a new quality and autonomous driving becomes real. Uber and Lyft have already changed the world - you can press an icon on your phone and get an affordable ride wherever you want to go.  Does it really matter if a human is behind the wheel?  Even if self-driving cars were here, they'd charge whatever the market will bear, they wouldn't be anywhere near free. Private equity investors have been subsidizing rides on Uber for years now. New cars are coming with more active driver assist systems using cameras and radar. They're getting better and cheaper. Automating vehicles is an ongoing process. If you don't get too invested in the hype, then you won't get bogged down in the disillusion phase. I believe fully autonomous cars are definitely coming. It's hard to put a date on things like that, but it will happen before we know it. These so called 'news journalists' love poking fun at things they don't really understand until one day the right technology evolves and then all the stories will be about how amazing the SDC's are and how many lives are saved and how old/disabled/drunk people can now safely and easily get around. 

It always amazes me how over just a few months/years time the general consensus in media turns from laughing about how absurd some new thing is to how helpful and amazing it is. When the time is right all the stories about SDC's will change, you just wait and see. Don't get down because most articles are about how it won't work. These days it's the journalists job to pick a side and write about it, not deliver the facts. Since the average person doesn't really understand how exponential technology is growing it's easy for journalists to pander to that group and talk shit about SDC's.

Musk thinks he will have level 5 SDC's this year! That's freakin incredible. Even if he is wrong and it takes 5 more years- THAT'S STILL FREAKING INCREDIBLE!!! It's coming. Not today, not tomorrow, but soon enough. 

Don't stress yourself worrying what all the naysayers are spouting off about. Rest assured, there are positive people left in the world, they just don't need to yell their opinions at everyone else. People try to base the future off the past.  With any disruptive technology that generally does not work.  The only past data that is relevant is the rate of computational/sensor/developmental improvement.  The very first self driving cars ever used for 'anything at a research level was all the way back in 2004 for the DARPA challenge.   That was truly ""Year 1"".   To give an analogy, commercial digital photography first came around in the 1980s, but it wasn't until the early 2000s that the technology became good enough, and cheap enough, to replace film.  Every year they were getting better, but were still so crappy that people didn't see the big picture.  I remember I was 15 years old in 1999 and my parents were photographers.  I was at one of their photo processing/camera stores and I remember asking about digital photography (mainly because I was using the internet and wanted a way to get pictures of my nerdy ass self to my internet friends).  The response I got was basically some smug operator telling me that digital cameras are stupid, are shit, maybe are ok for some niche application but will NEVER replace film and he doesn't deal with low end people and I was sort of a dumb kid for even asking about it.   By 2003 he was out of business.   That pessimism did him a whole lot of good.   His claim wasn't ""oh it may take another 5 or so years until digital is good"" but that digital photography will NEVER be taken seriously.  Never.    Not by 2005, not by 2010, 2015 or 2020. Film was a giant, Kodak was a giant, nothing is going to change that.   These were people who had more professional industry experience behind them than year I spent alive at the time.    


The big picture I am extremely optimistic about self driving cars.  As I mentioned up above, this isn't something that started in 2017, or 2009 (when Google started) but all the way back to 2004.  This is something that has been in the process for 15 years now and has seen progress, and major progress every single year.  Everything about them is getting better.  The processors, the sensors, the network connectivity, the machine learning, the artificial intelligence, ALL of it is getting better.   Eventually its going to hit a threshold where it works good enough to go live.    We had a Waymo rider post in this sub a while back and the question I had for them was ""Over the course of your Waymo ridership, have you noticed any increase in driving capability or reduction of driver takeovers"" and the person mentioned that they noticed a considerable improvement over the course of a year.   If Google decided to build a planned community in Silicon Valley and have all the private roads SDC the technology they have is now good enough.  Get rid of the human drivers and redesign a few of the roads and what they have now works.  Get rid of the human drivers and 2019 SDC tech works.  Because we have to mix the two its going to take a while longer.  Not several decades though.  Road improvements will come and make the technology work if need be.    


My prediction is that some commercial transportation as a service company will go live in some market in America in 2021 or 2022 (2024 or 2025 at the very latest).   This may likely be Waymo with their 80,000 pacificas and 20,000 Ipaces they plan on putting online over the next few years (which can effectively serve as many as 800k-1M people per day).   The fact they are talking to manufactures in Detroit seriously tells me this is something that they seriously intend to do.   The market that it will go live in will probably be Arizona, Nevada, and/or California.  Tesla may beat them to the punch with their Tesla network program.   It may be neither one and could be GM's Cruise, or Zoox, or MobileEye.   The dust is still up in the air for as to ""who""it is going to be but it is going to be someone.  There is a trillion dollar profit motive to get this going.   Someone is going to figure it out.   Very smart, motivated and 'greedy' people don't leave a pile of a trillion dollars just sitting there.   Waymo is probably going to be the one who starts the race.  But someone is definitely going to start it.  When people who massively doubt this technology will 'ever' and that its all a pipe dream, they remind me of the guy at the film processing place telling me that Digital Photography, will 'never' take on.    A lot of people have mentality that progress in this area is literally impossible and improvements in the technology are impossible.   Despite the fact that dozens of companies are aggressively spending billions of dollars on this technology, its all just a big scam.   


Anyways.  My prediction on the rollout.  My year is 2021.  If we all did a gambling pool that would be the year I would throw my bet in.  I could be wrong, it could be 2022, or 2023, or even 2020.  Its going to be isolated to a few places in the US at first.  But those places could be little backwater villages like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and a few other key places in the west.   Because of the multiplier effect (1 car serves 8-12x the people as an individually owned car) the adopters will be pretty quick.  Current Uber/Lyft users in these areas who do not own a car (which includes myself) will have the option of summoning a TAAS car to replace their Uber.  I predict that these TAAS cars will be priced to be dramatically cheaper than Uber on day 1.  Even if its only 30% cheaper.    In places like LA where driving is a pain in the ass, people are going to use the TAAS.  Hell, it may be cheaper to use TAAS than to park in LA (and definitely easier).   The TAAS adoption will happen very quickly with current Uber/Lyft users.  Whatever fleet company is running the cars will have no issue finding customers.    


I have made the prediction before, but I think there will be use of SDC cars at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.  Japan is going to be the focus of the world for a few weeks and they are going to want to show off the absolute best of the best technology their country has to offer.  

Within a very short period of time there will be a massive user base.   Transportation is a major expense for a lot of people and if this service is a viable way to save money I believe. Waymo is the closest. Nope. We are in the trough of disillusionment Self-driving cards are an inevitability. Companies pushed efforts out items early. However, there are self-driving shuttles in several cities. Companies are investing in it or have strategies. Many of these companies are less visible, because they haven't promised everyone the world or kept projects behind closed doors.  As people said it is a  disillusionment period for the public. Don't fall for the hype train. The progress is going to be steady and continuous.  Your big auto manufacturers and their partners are investing and working. They are a bit more careful about releases than, say, Musk. As if some communications major writing tech articles has any idea. When will Level 4 arrive? The engineers don’t know, I don’t know and the knucklehead writing the article doesn’t know. They are all noise. You got to remember that in 2004 SDVs were a DARPA pipe dream that didn’t work at all. We’ve come a long way since then. Seems like we are more than half way there. If Elon Musk wasn't out there lying endlessly about the SD capabilities of his shoddy cars public expectations would probably be lower. When the guy stands on a stage [promising](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/elon-musk-says-tesla-robotaxis-will-hit-the-market-next-year.html) a *million* self driving Tesla robotaxis on the road by 2020 I can almost hear the Simpsons' ""monorail"" song. It's not going to happen all at once. SDCs will start popping up in limited use in places where they can safely be used, like Waymo's limited Chandler area. In a few years, multiple cities will have limited Chandler-like areas where you might get picked up by an SDC or you might get picked up by a regular old car. ""Multiple investments in driverless cars over the past year have resulted in the total funding for the technology topping $100bn""  [https://www.ns-businesshub.com/transport/investments-driverless-cars/](https://www.ns-businesshub.com/transport/investments-driverless-cars/) 

Almost every major car company is plowing huge amounts of money into this tech at increasing speeds. In other words, all the biggest car experts are teaming with all the biggest automation experts and together deciding that this will work, and they're putting their money where their mouth is. I think Elon described it well. 99% is easy and then each additional 9 is exponentially harder. We can already see 99% on the road. THose are the easy trips where nothing unsual happens.

99.9 will be much much harder. Then 99.99 will be virtually unrecognizable in terms of the tech that made 99.9 work. Then 99.999 will be again virtually unrecognizable to the system that made 99.99 work.

I think the harsh reality is we're assuming that we can just take the 99% tech and tweak it to get each additional 9. I don't think that's right. I think each 9 will require almost a fundamental leap foward in the hardware and software. Meaning there's akmost no chace that the tech powering 99% will be the same as what powers 99.9. Etc.

Meaning no car on the road today will do 99.9, that will require a brand new paradigm with different hardware. And then again when 99.9 is available none of *those* cars will be able to do 99.99. Etc.

I think this is why it's so far off. Regarding the ""tone of articles"",

Bringing general bad news to the public sells more than announcing ""development is on track"". Crushing people's expectations creates controversy and buzz, and writing about how some test failed or how some company abandoned the race, or how development is taking ""much more time than anticipated"" has big impact, requires little effort and the stakes are very low for any misinformation provided.

That's why once the visibility of SDCs gained momentum, journalists began their dirty work. I think in 5 years it's possible we'll have self driving cars that can handle any road in every major city and their near-surrounding areas, then probably another 5-10 years to be able to handle more rural areas. 

If you think about something like the smart phone, with the iPhone being released in 2007, it took just 10 years to go from something completely state of the art, to them basically having 'run out' of super crazy new features, and pretty much everybody has a smart phone.

I think the stuff we'll have in 10 years will be pretty mindblowing considering how fast technology accelerates. It'll happen. The media is intellectually and tactfully dumb, ignore their articles save for direct quotes or reporting of actual evidence. Without a doubt. The tech is already 99.99999% there and probably much safer on average then human drivers, they just need to go through the arduous process of certification and edge case removal. I’d give it 5, at most 10 years until full SDC starts to be offered to consumers Optimistic, but I never bought into the ""self driving cars in 2020!"" stuff.  But I'm optimistic that it will happen.  15 years ago I wasn't, I thought it wasn't technologically feasible, but now I think it is, it'll just take more time.  I think there will be level 4 by 2030. Yesterday I read about a person getting hit by a self driving car. Then I read more and came to find out the person was wearing headphones, on a cell phone, and walked right into traffic. What do people expect? So sad how easy it is for the glass is half empty crowd to manipulate the gullible. Simple. The AI needed is way off in the next century. The road needs to be reinvented as well.  Humans are awesome don't give up on us yet. The American road way has given 100's of millions of people the ability to prosper like no other country on this scale. We ll need to wait at least 4 more years... When 5g becomes common place 🙂 but I would say sdc will be able to transport children and elderly before 2030 🙂 many things will happen during the next 10 years. Look at how it was in 2009 😉 The media and general public are short sighted and want / need instant gratification. Ignore the negative articles as nothing is stopping SDC's from being a reality within years. Not decades. [deleted] I am! 

Last week in my Tesla Model 3, I used Navigate on Autopilot for over 30 minutes straight without needing to intervene, including merging onto the 405 freeway and the 10 freeway during Los Angeles rush hour! I literally didn’t manually steer, accelerate or use the brakes once during that time. I was like magic. 

Level 5 autonomy is still a ways off, but it should not overlooked how much progress has been made since I got my first Tesla (Model S) back in June 2016. I've been saying for years that the single biggest thing that will hold back SDC mass adoption is going to be  FUD created (accidentally or deliberately) by the media, and that's exactly what's playing out now. It'll pass though.

The media are always looking for 'new' when it comes to news. 3000+ people die on the roads every day worldwide, so any individual death by idiot driver is unlikely to be more than a local story at best. And person being slightly injured in traffic accident would probably struggle to make it to that person's Facebook feed, unless there is a unique angle on it.

And that unique angle is often '[SDC involved](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700482/navya-self-driving-driverless-bus-vienna-collision-pedestrian)' even if, by the sounds of it in this case, entirely blamelessly.

Meanwhile the tech is making slow and steady progress, which again doesn't make for exciting news. 'Car drives yet another 10,000 miles without anything interesting happening' isn't going to get the eyeballs that a story needs to be worth writing.

This is what happens with any new tech. Steady progress news is swamped by panicky danger news. When mobiles really started to take off, there was a raft of 'will their signals give you cancer?' type stories, and far less 'person made calls to friends and arranged drinks' ones. And for a time, a lot of people will read the streams of negative headlines and be convinced that SDCs are a menace to our roads, just like many were convinced that mobile phones were a complete waste of time.

Yet the tech continues to progress and it's all but inevitable that it will eventually become so mainstream that people will look back on the discussion like we look back on when people through that [self-driving lifts were a deathtrap](https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/100-years-ago-we-feared-a-different-kind-of-driverless-vehicle.html). Ignore the shitty articles.

I think the companies working on autonomous vehicles are actually over-complicating their solutions. It's not necessary to solve the problem completely like many companies seem to be trying to do. There are a lot of measures that could be taken to mitigate the worst case failure modes. Sooner or later, someone will take that approach and get this technology into the market. Not in this fucking subreddit, that's for damn sure. I'm thinking Elon will be the first with Level 3 for the freeway in 3 years. I think that we have to wait somewhere around 5 years for self-driving cars. I worked as an IT platform engineer for R&D of one of major automotive company. There are a lot of challenges, both software and hardware technologies are not capable yet, especially when you have to deal with enormous size of the data. Once you have a solid ground, I guess AI trainings will be developed pretty quickly. There are many people so fascinated by AI possibilities, that it will be just a matter of time, to get what we need in order to replace ordinary driver. I think right now people are very impatient to come up with those new tools and ideas that could be brought into real life. Autonomous cars will probably start domino effect and perpetuate implementing AI usage in other areas of industry. [removed]","Is there ANYONE optimistic about self-driving cars anymore? During 2018 and 2019, the tenor surrounding the self-driving industry has become incredibly gloomy. Nowadays there seems to be multiple news articles cropping up every day that amount to ""Haha, self-driving cars failed! None of the promises made by tech companies materialized! Enjoy driving manually for decades if not forever, you fucking losers!""

As someone that had a stroke and isn't capable of driving himself around because my cognitive abilities are too damaged, this isn't good for my (already broken) mental health. I can respect articles that have a bleak outlook on the future of SDCs if they simply relay information impassively, but the tone of articles along these lines is often smug and borders on taunting. It's great that people who don't have stakes in this matter either way, who can just hop in a car and go wherever they want whenever they want, can laugh at an industry running into some trouble - but for some of us that are disabled, and alternate between guilt over being a burden to their loved ones and terror at wondering how they'll get by if they ever find themselves in a position where nobody will help them... it doesn't feel good to have people gloat over the potential failure of something that is an important source of hope for us (and that's something which is beyond rampant here on this subreddit, where seemingly 90 percent of the posters here are either skeptical of the technology or against it outright). A robust public transport system would make this *much* less relevant of an issue, but America isn't known for its public transportation.

&#x200B;

So, is there anyone out there (whether companies or random redditors) who think that self-driving cars actually have a bright future, and that said future will arrive at a reasonably decent speed? I hope this is just a hideously fucking horrible trough, and that we look back at 2018 and 2019 and think ""we really were excessively pessimistic"" like with all those people during the 1990s and very early 2000s who thought the internet was a failure because it took a few years to take off."

Even my brain gets fooled by shadows occasionally. I was walking in the parking lot the other day and the shadow of a flag made me think something just flew in my path and I changed my walking direction for a split second lol

Driving a car with a L2 system, I try to look at the road differently, and the amount of things that could confuse even a human... This stuff is far away.

The main advantage is the car has more data points. Unless maybe you count interpreting the cars around us... If I see the car in front of me just drove the same area fine, a shadow is much less likely to confuse me. This isn’t new news. It’s well known that even the most advanced computer vision programs today can be fooled with oddly chosen images. An undergrad at CMU did a research paper showing that the leading image classifiers can be fooled into thinking humans are a sheet of A4 paper with odd designs on it... You can also confuse human drivers with “adversarial” objects. What else is new? Sounds like LiDAR researchers re-""discovered"" what the Air Force learned during development of the F-117...  A simple camera will handle these cases, the same way human eyes do.

""Hey let's start a business based on thumbing or noses at taxi laws figuring that cities won't want to enforce their own Laws in the face of innovation"". To be fair to Uber ATG they have done massive restructuring of their program to ensure safety is the first priority after that accident. Also note that “Our self driving vehicles are acceptably safe to operate on public roads” is a mission statement or statement of intent. It’s the bar they are hoping to reach.

In the meantime Waymo and Tesla are testing their self driving vehicles in ways that don’t kill people (no, misuse of cruise control is not “testing a self driving vehicle”). Waymo has actual self driving vehicles driving on roads in relatively controlled environments with oversight negotiated with the state. Tesla is testing virtual self driving vehicles hidden inside the computers of customers’ cars.

To me, Tesla seems to be the company taking the most sensible approach by loading their existing human driven vehicles with SDC testing labs. If the SDC makes a mistake, that is reported back to the mothership with enough context to figure out what is going on. Tesla SDC do not engage in phantom braking which endangers others, and failure to stop for pedestrians will not actually kill anyone.

Waymo is taking a cautious approach too by limiting top speeds, restricting operational area and carefully learning the traffic in that area before expanding the test further.

How does a self driving car fail safely? One option would be something like the Automated Flight Termination System attached to Falcon 9: an independent processor that monitors the car’s behaviour and severs the connection to the self driving computer when a failure is detected, bringing the car to a safe halt with hazard lights engaged? Should there be opportunity for a human to take control?

Who would you trust with your life and the lives of your family and friends? Uber who actively campaigns against wages, taxation, regulation and workers rights? Google who will use any information they can collect to produce more valuable dossiers to sell to advertisers? Tesla who just want to sell you cool cars?

lol. Mr Musk is way out of his depth on this one. Even if dead reckoning does work, most garages have a different entrance than the exit, and also possibly other cars and people moving around. I love my model 3 but I also believe Tesla should be sued for misleading the customers and consistent lies I think FSD on roads is different than parking lots. Roads follow typical patterns, and cars traverse them in predictable ways. Parking lots can often be more random and chaotic. The good thing about nailing parking lots is all the training for ""drivable space"" and curbs will transfer over to FSD, particularly tricky FSD situations. Laws are a big thing for preventing tech from becoming its best.","""Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem."" What happened to Elon? https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1150113206414610432

What caused the sudden turn around?  Over the past years, Elon has infamously said such things as:

* self-driving is easier than people think

* self-driving is a solved problem

* 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely

* multiple 2 year time frames going back 4 years

* cross country drive with no interventions

* all cars have the hardware for FSD (three hardware versions ago)

Hell, as recently as a couple months ago he was touting their hardware capabilities and exponential improvements and saying ~~no hands required on the wheel by Q3 of *this year,* and full-self driving, no attention required 6 months after that~~ capable of hands off, looking out the window by Q2 of 2020 and driving empty some time in 2020.

Cut to just a couple months later and he's firing a large portion of his team and saying ""parking lots are a hard problem.""  Well, no sh*t!  But what the hell happened?!  What caused this sudden shift?  Is this a sign that he's waking up to the reality of the situation and we'll hear fewer unrealistic timelines from him?  How can you reconcile saying parking lots are hard and we need to review them with almost simultaneously saying FSD is right around the corner?"

Edit: stolen from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1150194483570438144) by /u/binarybits. Factor 1: ""I wouldn't get into electric cars and rockets if I wasn't optimistic."" - also Elon Musk. 

Factor 2: I think Elon multiplies his own work x100 staff x100 hours per week and uses that to judge his timelines. 

Factor 3: I think software timelines are much harder to predict than hardware. 

Factor 4: Everyone else seems to be pushing their FSD timelines back as well. Wait a minute, you're telling me Elon's estimates aren't accurate? It's EST - Elon Standard Time ""I may not always be on time.  But I get it done""  - Elon Musk  


  
Anyone would be a total success story to start a new American Car company and then outsell Cadillac and Lincoln combined within less than a decade of their first original product hitting the market. Completely fair to call this out. Obviously a lot of people overpromised, nothing wrong with noting that. Here is the companion official Tesla Blog post from the same day:
https://www.tesla.com/blog/summon-your-tesla-your-phone

>During this Beta stage of Summon, we would like customers to become familiar with it on private property. Eventually, **your Tesla will be able to drive anywhere across the country to meet you**, charging itself along the way. He did say about A couple months ago: by the end of the year, any Tesla will be able to drive anywhere as a taxi. 


This week: If we work really hard, we might be able to have a car come to you from the parking lot by the end of the year.  Then we can start working on having it park itself. .. I like Elon but he's such a bullshitter. Basically take any of his estimates and multiply it by at least 5 (probably 10) to get a realistic timeline. People get excited and buy cars based on these timelines and claims. It’s wrong to make claims like this and sell a product (FSD). Some points in defence of Elon Musk and his FSD/Summon predictions:

1) Tesla severed its partnership with Mobileye in June 2016. Having to start from scratch surely added about 2 years onto the problem.

2) Most people know FSD/Summon is a hard problem and predictions are just as hard to make. In the scheme of things it doesn't matter if predictions are off by a few years. Making predictions about new technology is always hard and to bash Elon for not knowing the future 100% seems misguided, in the context of him being the most visionary person alive.

3) When he says 'feature complete' or solved problem, he is talking about taking their existing approach and scaling it up. Here is a good tech presentation on Tesla's FSD approach: https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness. There will be a period of 2-10 years of refinement, legalisation and roll-out. I'm sure California will see FSD long before the rest of the world.

4) There are many incremental steps towards FSD and if you check the Tesla website you can see that selling FSD gives customers things like NOA which is something Tesla owners really value: https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/model3/design#autopilot

5) There is no-one doing better. No-one can compete with the data advantage Tesla has, and they are doing a lot of work to leverage that advantage. I don't get why so many people bash Elon Musk and Tesla when he is doing better on FSD than anyone else. It's like the parents who's kid get 98% on a test and they say, why didn't you get 100%? Give the guy a break. If you think you can do better start your own car company from scratch.

6) Kind of related to point 2 but more general to AI... There have been a lot of predictions by AI experts historically which were either hugely optimistic or pessimistic in retrospect. In the 70s many experts  thought AI would solve everything very soon, but there was a very long period of disappointment until neural networks and machine learning started taking off recently. Now some of the predictions are turning out to be too pessimistic like with Alpha Go. The point is that there are good technical reasons for having difficulty in making accurate predictions in AI. We are talking about AI researchers/experts who know the technologies in detail making inaccurate predictions, not the Reddit peanut gallery. It’s well known that he’s wildly over optimistic with predictions and schedule.

Falcon Heavy is actually late by 4-5 years. Compared to that, his Tesla related predictions are that bad.

While I like Autopilot very much and think it’s a super stress reliever, I’m not impressed with its progress during the past 3-4 months. After the 2019.8.5 update, I haven’t identified meaningful improvements. Just so we’re clear, nobody actually believed him right? LOL xDDDD Elon Musk is sooooooooooooooo dumb xDDDDDDD TAKE THAT, PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGY XDDDDD THE WORLD DIDN'T BECOME A BETTER PLACE AFTER ALL, YOU FUCKING MORONS XDDDDDDDDDDDDD He has also had a lot of theft and corporate theft of talent and people arrogant creating issues. The bible said the second coming will be ""soon"". Summon will be here ""soon"" too. Elon delivers, but his watch is in Latin American Standard Time It was not populism, it was underestimation. He will do it. While many populist promises by politicians will remain undone for decades. It is normal btw. Elon overestimates a timeline. in other news, water is wet. [deleted] Let's face it.  Elon  is not a tech genius he's an incredible entrepreneur.  His job is to promote and push his businesses as far as possible and has been accused in the past (and fined) for manipulating his stock prices.  He constantly over promises as a sales and thought leadership tool.  The tech will arrive but I would be surprised if we see level 5 at any single digit level of penetration in the next 5 years.","3.5 years ago this week: Elon: ""In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"" "

&#x200B;

Why: tech progress is rarely linear - we have long periods where seemingly nothing happens. Step functions are much more historically common and increasingly with ML, geometric growth functions are taking over.  

&#x200B;

See, humans suck at understanding & predicting geometric growth. It's not how we evolved - almost no one \*intuitively\* understands it. Try it out - ask 100 people on the street how much money they would have if they received $0.01 on day 1, $0.02 on day 2, $0.04 on day 3, $0.08 on day 4, etc.  In my experience most people don't think they would have more than $1M by day 30. Lions, tigers, and bears did not chase our ancestors in a geometric growth fashion.

&#x200B;

Remember Google in 1998?  It was \*marginally\* better than AltaVista. But that little question next to each result ""Was this relevant? yes/no"" started the geometric growth.

&#x200B;

Second: people who make tech predictions usually sound like asshats after the step/geometric progress function moves.  History is littered with these case studies:

What does this mean ?,0," If you have teleportation you don’t need a self-driving car... There's also the psychological barrier.  I'm fine being driven by a human I don't personally know like when in an Uber or a Cab.  But the idea of being driven by a human who wouldn't suffer any immediate physical consequence of a car accident they cause makes me uneasy. Do you mean remote control as opposed to teleportation? It doesn’t change anything, because for the most part, that’s already possible. The reason it’s not implemented is because it’s not scaleable, and therefore too expensive. It’s like asking why everyone doesn’t pay for a personal driver, or exclusively take Ubers. I think telepresence or tele-oportation could actually play a big roll in self driving cars.  

Teleportation is the wrong word.  In standard English teleportation is mainly reserved for things like Star Trek. Remote control requires constant reliable signal, which you are not going to get with cellular services anywhere — at least not reliable enough to operate equipment where people’s lives are on the line.

However if such a feature could be provided safely, there’s very little difference between hiring someone to remote control your vehicle versus manually controlling the vehicle (ie: contract driver or chauffeur). That there is not a healthy market for contract driving (hey valet can you take the car over to the other side of town to pick the kids up from school then bring them back to me?) suggests that the cost of providing the labour hours required is prohibitive.

Even if you only pay for the hours you use, that’s going to be equivalent to paying a taxi fare on top of the cost of ownership of the vehicle. SDCs are trying to solve the human errors part of driving. Now you got teleoperation with humans, since you said SDC software isn’t good enough so it’s replaced by teleoperation, you are back to square one lol, plus the network problem and responsibility problems. Uhhh... remote driving SDCs is nothing new, there’s a number of companies that have offered that as a service to SDC companies for years now. One thing that comes to mind is. What if some company creates a self driving program so vast that it can not be ran on the on board computer. 

So there would be one computer that controls the car with a slight delay from somewhere far away and maybe another, dumber computer that would make the car drive on roadside if the connection fails. 

Then there could be some kind of a fee that you would have to pay for each time you drive. That could be a big incentive for a system like this. Also it would safeguard the system against competition. It would be hard to reverse engineer a self driving computer if you did not have access to it.","Teleportation for self driving is available tommorow. What does this mean ?

The main reason Tesla doesn’t use lidar isn’t the cost (as stated in this article) - obviously anyone in this industry knows the cost of lidar will drop substantially in the next few years. Tesla isn’t using lidar because they think that the only way to get level 5 is with vision, and relying on lidar would be a crutch that gives a false sense of progress and distracts from getting vision to be perfect. Does anyone know why ""moving parts issue"" seems to not be a problem now (instead of two years ago)?

Toyota expects to have a range of 621 miles by 2025 on the Mirai.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toyota-hydrogen/toyota-plans-to-expand-production-shrink-cost-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-idUSKBN1KG0Y0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toyota-hydrogen/toyota-plans-to-expand-production-shrink-cost-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-idUSKBN1KG0Y0)",SelfDrivingCars,Will battery electric vehicle adoption hit a wall in the era of robotaxis?,0," I think batteries will win out as they are dropping in price every year and putting KWHs in a battery is a lot cheaper than fuel cell systems and certainly cheaper than gasoline.   Its much easier to get electricity to 50,000 cars spread out over a city than have one monster fueling station fuel up 50,000 cars daily.   In order for SDC Taxis to really take off you are going to have 2-3 parked nearby you most of the time so the time from summoning to arrival is a minute or two and it doesn't have to come from some centralized location. Have Walmart given up on their effort to implement a QR-code based pay-by-phone mechanism to compete with ApplePay?

Just because Walmart does something doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do. They just hope they have enough weight in the market to influence the outcome.

The cost of fuel cell versus BEV forklifts will eventually bring Walmart around to realising that having a few extra cheap forklifts charging is cheaper than providing the hydrogen fuelled forklifts and the infrastructure to safely operate that fleet.

CurrentC died on 2016. Walmart then created Walmart Pay, which apparently still uses the “scan a QR code” method. So perhaps the nightmare is still alive. Battery electric seems like a dumb term, what other kind of personal electric vehicle is there? 

It would make sense if some cars used tram electric grids, but they don't.

Some seem to use it to contrast to hybrids, but they also use batteries. I think at this point, as long as nothing unexpected happens, electric will beat out everything.   The only downside to batteries is their refuel time.  Right now the fastest chargers charge a 300 mile range car from 20% to 80% in about 30 minutes.  This means they need 6x the space to refuel than other energy types.

There is not a range problem since batteries can be sized to match the range of any other vehicle running on other fuels.  This would increase the space needed to refuel as the charging would take longer.

The question is not does this single downside matter?  Atlanta would need ~700k AVs to fully run the city autonomously.  Given that each one needs 30 minutes to charge and ignoring any charging that could be done between 6am and 9pm, this means they need the capacity to charge 40k cars at a single time.  Assuming the SDC is roughly the size of a Pacificia and you would need 2x that much space so you could clean it, etc; you would need ~400 acres of facility to have that capacity.  Given that Atlanta is pretty big, lets say you have 9 facilities around the city and each is 100 acres so 900 acres so about the same as 45 Walmarts.  There are about 60 Walmarts in Atlanta, so it is pretty close.

This seems like a reasonable scale of infrastructure to run all transit for Atlanta.  What would be the savings of only needing the same about of land of 10 Walmarts for a Hydrogen system?  Obviously it would be 4x cheaper in land costs, but how much extra in fuel costs?  How much extra since a Hydrogen engine lasts 4x less miles than an electric one? You're forgetting the costs of maintenance. Battery cars and infrastructure are amazing because they require little to no maintenance. No pumps to maintain, no fuel to transfer, no insulated tanks, or pressure relief valves. Right now the Toyota Mirai costs $58500 for 312 miles of range. A model 3 Long range costs $49000 for 310 miles. So the upfront cost is more and maintenance is more. Last, is that the new 250kw superchargers add 200 miles of range in less than 20 minutes. These cars will need to be be cleaned throughout the day, so even if cleaning the car takes 10 minutes, in that time you've added over 100 miles of range. So starting the day with a full charge and only charging once for ten minutes halfway through the day gives over 400 miles of range. In NYC a taxi driver typically drives 180 miles a day in a 12 hour shift. So the 400 miles is ~220% of a NYC taxi drivers daily miles. If you take package drop offs into account the situation probably improves. It takes time to unload packages and that entire time the car will be staying still. Because of the variability of rider demand throughout the day, no self driving car will be operational 24 hours a day. Any fleet will need enough capacity to cover rush hour traffic. That means a lot of vehicles idle at 3 am. They will have plenty of downtime to charge. Additionally, charge times continue to drop. Infrastructure problem will plague fuel cells. To the contrary, autonomy will be a major factor in causing the shift to all BEV.","Will battery electric vehicle adoption hit a wall in the era of robotaxis? I say yes. For the same reason Walmart went with fuel cell forklifts over bevs.

I'm surprised they don't have millions of unique simulations running simultaneously, but I really don't have any insight into how useful that would be compared to what they're doing. How many real world miles are they at now ? So how many more billion miles does it need before it can successfully merge into a lane with moderate traffic? [deleted] Thing is everytime their software stack has an update be it in perception/prediction/planning etc. The prior simulated miles with the older software stack are not entirely useful anymore. So the cumulative simulated miles aren't the best metric I feel. Wake me up  when they finally pull out safety drivers from their cars. Until that this is all just very expensive video games. How helpful/useful/realistic are the simulations compared to real driver data? It's welcome stuff, but really would like to see them expand into general public usage soon. I’d really like Google to spin them off.  Seems like a really great investment opportunity I wonder how many miles in Google Captchas they have? I think they are calling Lidar limited because it doesn’t see it just uses radar and other technology. And can lidar tell between a weightless pillow on a highway and a 300 kg rock that would kill you? If it can’t see then the data isn’t being captured to differentiate. 

That said, I don’t know the answer to whether if you were to back test Waymo’s Lidar system once they say they’re able to safely full self drive in any scenario Tesla’s data could put it through. But I think this test will be doable and we will know the answer. Note that Tesla tests with radars and lidar too but ditched it in their cars (kept radar ditched lidar). Even if Lidar does work well enough then it’s clunky equipment vs subtle, inexpensive cameras. So the cost curve is out of favour even if the tech can be their, but I don’t know if we have seen proof that it can’t get there. Let's not forget about the Tesla Shadow mode that runs and compares its neural net to what happens in irl. Everyone should watch the Tesla self driving presentation.

I would have thought 5x that number of people if they wanted it as fast as they’re saying. Tesla is not going to leapfrog the guys on top.  I wouldn't be surprised if they're realizing this is more difficult than they initially supposed and the realities of the problem are becoming more apparent to them. I think I've voiced this concern before, but all other Elon ventures haven't been anywhere close to this ML heavy.

 Reusing rockets is a very challenging engineering problem, in the traditional tight constraints, lots of pieces kind of way. This does not look good, Tesla still losing money, stock goes down even when market still goes up, Elon gets more and more unhinged by the day, hoping that FSD will be the Tesla's savior and probably doing more damage for FSD prospects than good. Is this just another instance of terminating the bottom 10% in performance reviews? Decimation! I think the problem is similar to the way many managers will push unrealistic expectations on software development teams.  Only in this case the consequences of rushing and having subpar code or bugs or insufficient testing is people dying and the company shutting down and potentially setting self driving cars back years with bad press.

So it's not surprising that engineers quit. This makes me so happy. I can’t see progress in the last 12 months. I was more trusting of AP 10 months ago. My impression as an engineer they probably changed the software architecture and got back to the same performance.  The development needs to be broken into separable and manageable pieces and not ignore the small things. Nvidia has be able to do this from a cursory review of their website and videos.

Tesla is training Autopilot to [look at the adjacent lane for possible cut-ins](https://youtu.be/Ucp0TTmvqOE?t=7779), so I think it should be possible to train it to start slowing down in these situations. What it should be doing is recognizing that there is insufficient data to predict safe road ahead, and slowing down accordingly.

Yes, it would be ideal if it could take cues from other lanes, improve the intelligence of the algorithm, use higher resolution cameras, etc. 

But even with those fixes, there will probably always be corner cases where data is simply insufficient, and it should slow and/or force manual control. Say it with me: CARS STOPPED ON AN EXIT RAMP ARE NOT A CORNER CASE.

They're not even an edge case for God's sake, that's just everyday driving. It’s hard to say what would have happened without the disengagement.  I think it would have stopped, but with a less comfortable stopping distance than would be normal for a human driver. My M S autopilot stops on the freeway for stuff that’s not really there, like shadows under a bridge and yours doesn’t stop for stuff that is there. Niccccceeee. Teslas have a long history of not recognizing stopped cars/trucks/firetrucks in the lane. Or objects moving across the lane left-to-right, etc. Or fixed objects like lane dividers.  Radar is no good for objects that aren't moving towards or away from from the Tesla.  This is where LiDAR or HD maps would help, but Elon is opposed.  Tesla's vision system always seems to want confirmation from the radar about objects in the path. This is a problem when they aren't moving at all.  Tesla's vision system has a long way to go. Tesla drivers need to constantly monitor the roadway ahead for years to come. They're nowhere near self-driving. Expect many more accidents and deaths soon from all the new Teslas hitting the roads. [deleted] Perfect scenario where lidar would have easily recognized the stopped vehicles long before camera based sensors would. I'm guessing that it was reluctant to stop due to two main factors:

- it just went under an overpass. The shadow appears as a dark non-moving object on the road that is safe to pass. It is likely that another dark non-moving shape on the road will be another overpass.
- Stopped traffic on the highway after clear roads is uncommon

I bet it would have stopped when it got closer still. But obviously it is good that the driver chose not to experiment. Maybe the autopilot should follow the speed recommendation of 50mph for this turn, instead of the 63mph it was doing when it passed the sign, thus giving it more time to detect the stopped traffic. A very similar thing happened to me. Would have died if I wasn't paying attention. Here is the footage:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKfXcEAVzoE This is an example where V2V technology might really help.

I can’t take him seriously on any autopilot predictions if it can’t turn left at a traffic light today. 

FSD is all about the 9s. The ability to handle ever more rare and complex scenarios.  FSD will need to be able to handle something like 99.9999% of driving scenarios. Tesla’s can arguably handle 75% (being very generous here) each additional 9 will take as much effort as the previous. Waymo might be at 90%. This will only work if Tesla will be a monopoly, imo that's unlikely. I am of two minds about this.

If this helps get cars off the road by making it easier for people who don’t want to own cars but feel like they need to, good.  If it helps as a sort of private-public transport in general, good.  If it can help people who can’t drive (disability, age, etc.), it’s good.

On the other hand, I wasn’t opposed to listing a Tesla I would own with the robotaxi service if it were opt-in.  This price increase makes it sound near mandatory.  A price Tesla/Musk feels needs justifying by claiming “But look, you’ll be making $400,000 to $500,000 over the life of this car!  That makes this a steal.”.

Looking at Turo, Lyft, and Uber... I don’t know if the rural area I live in will bring in enough revenue.  It almost seems like I would need a second car in addition to the Tesla because I would need it working as much as possible to pay for itself.  That like almost every gig economy job I would be paying Tesla for the privilege of working as their local maintenance/cleaning person.  

Hell, paying them and almost certainly getting the loan and interest from them to.  What would I tell the bank?  “Yeah, I’d like to take a loan out for a car.  Yes, it costs more than my house, but you see it won’t depreciate.  It’ll be an AI powered Taxi that will double, maybe triple, my house hold income automagically!” This seems logical, based on the assumptions stated in the article, from a revenue-generating perspective AND a get-EVs-on-the-road perspective. Since cars are used roughly only 6% of the time, shifting the entire production over to mobility-as-a-service should change that number to 50+%, reducing the number of ICE cars more significantly than straight sales. 

I would hope, however, that the car price remains the same but, if anything, the FSD price ratchets up significantly. Or you could even have several price tiers: just the car, FSD for personal use, FSD for network use. I wrote about this back in 2016. This is why I got my FSD contract in writing. Just like taxi medallions the FSD licenses will cost a fortune because they will be limited by fleet allowances. When FSD is solved it will cost more than the car because it could earn 100k a year by working in a fleet. I would really rather have all the semi drivers off the road first. Why not a fleet of Tesla trucks? Sounds like blackmail to get more people to buy a Tesla NOW. Another reason it will never ever work is that atleast where I live every single person who has a job needs a car to drive there, and almost everybody finishes work at between 3 and 4 so like... am I gonna have to sit together with someone else in a car? Or wait until one is available.. or what? Why not just take the bus then? So dumb. 
I want to own my own car and I will never «share» it.
In fact I think few people will want to share it.

However, I'm not sure what the actual value of such a diagram is, other than (maybe) reminding people which companies do what. Also, where's Zoox? Interesting graph. Do you have a detailed breakdown of the connections, ex: GM is connected to Lyft because it owns 18.6 Class A shares of it ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-lyft/gm-considers-options-for-its-lyft-stake-following-ipo-idUSKCN1QZ28S ) Walmart is connected to Gatik because it's one of Gatik's customers: https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/self-driving-delivery-van-startup-gatik-ai-comes-out-of-stealth-with-walmart-partnership/

I've created charts like this in the past when being introduced to new sectors and I've found that when you include historical ties, small cooperations etc, the graph becomes nearly fully connected. Some way to evaluate how or how much each company was connected (ex: color by ownership vs parternship vs patronage, increase line width by total $$$ being moved) would add a lot of context to the chart. There's gotta be a force-directed graph version of this :| From a couple months ago now, Tesla has not been using Nvidia in new cars. This needs to be interactive so that when you mouseover (or touch or click) a company name, it highlights the connections to other companies while dimming the others, like interactive airline route maps.

You really should do a force-directed layout for this. Then size the nodes by centrality.

A circle layout is incredibly confusing, especially if you don't sort the order of the nodes. This is just chaos.

Sure, you can argue people might take a car for things they'd currently take a flight for, and you'd be right. At the same time if I can have good transportation available cheaply at my destination (through fleet service) there are times I drive now where I'd rather fly just because I need a car once I get there and driving is cheaper than a flight *and* renting a car.

I'd expect flying to dip somewhat, but I doubt it will be catastrophic. Is there any precedent for this: do rich people use chaffeurs and special sleep cars for overnight long haul trips? Is that a thing? I'd still rather deal with an airport then do any drive over 7\~8 hours. Autopilot is nice but you still are sitting in a car for lots of hours.

&#x200B;

Now if self driving allows for 150+ mph speeds on highways then we are getting somewhere.... Door to Door service.  Right now a lot of people don't live near airports and may have to drive an hour or more to get to the airport, then drop off their car (or pay $50 for an Uber ride) and then do the whole airport ordeal.  Fly to their destination airport, then leave that airport and travel to their final destination.     


An AEV could pick you up in something that looks more like a recliner or bed at say 9pm.  At your house.  Then it drives you to your final destination only stopping to charge itself or if you need to use the restroom or eat something.   But for the most part you just sit back, watch TV, go to sleep and it does all the work.  Then by 9am, you are 600+ miles away, perhaps at your exact destination, not at an airport near your destination but at the exact address.    You arrive to your destination with more or less a full night's sleep. i’ve flown alone a lot and almost always only had to talk to 1 other person, the flight attendant with snacks They should.

No one in industry including Nvidia is trying to do a 100% end to end network as far as I'm aware. It just doesn't make sense to do that for full autonomy. Every self driving car will use maps.  The car will always know where it is on the map and where its destination is. A human, or fleet management software, will tell the car where to go and what roads to take getting there.

In the past few weeks, Apple snapped up autonomous vehicle start-up Drive.ai and Uber acquired Mighty AI, which provides training data for the computers that “drive” autonomous cars. Meanwhile Volkswagen severed its ties to Aurora, a Silicon Valley start-up backed by Amazon, in preparation for an expected partnership with Ford’s self-driving unit Argo AI.

Partnerships are not new in this sector. Alphabet’s self-driving division Waymo, widely considered the market leader, has been buying cars from Jaguar Land Rover and Chrysler rather than building them itself. Honda has partnered with General Motors’ Cruise unit and Volvo and Uber just unveiled their first jointly-developed mass produced autonomous cars after three years of working together.

But some industry analysts are wondering whether we are seeing the start of a round of consolidation in self-driving technology that will end up mirroring the one that engulfed the fledgling car industry.

At the start of the 20th century, there were more than 80 American carmakers, says Paul Ingrassia, editor at the Revs Institute, an automotive history and research centre.

But the spread of mass production and vertical integration thinned their ranks dramatically, as only a few companies could afford to invest in the factories and suppliers needed to compete. By 1929, three-quarters of US cars were made by the Big Three — Ford, GM and Chrysler — and the Depression knocked out most remaining independents. 

GM acquired a series of other automakers and suppliers in the 1900s and 1910s, most notably Cadillac, Buick and a ball bearings factory owned by the father of Alfred Sloan. He later, as head of GM, took advantage of all the marques to create a series of differently priced lines that avoided competing with one another. 

European carmaking also saw consolidation, leading to the emergence of Germany’s Daimler-Benz and the UK’s Austin and Morris among others.

Much of the 2019 dealmaking has seen big tech companies buy smaller ones. Some analysts suggest that reflects a growing recognition that it is going to be much harder than once thought to develop fully autonomous vehicles. Assistive technology, like self-parking and blind spot alerts, has spread rapidly, but high-profile accidents involving Tesla and Uber automated cars have highlighted the substantial hurdles ahead. 

“Everyone believes this is the future, but no one knows when or how we are going to get there,” says Mr Ingrassia.

Given the potential difficulties, some of the smaller self-driving companies are opting for buyouts rather than trying to convince their backers to keep funding them. In such cases, the big tech companies such as Apple and Waymo have more cash to burn on acquisitions than the carmakers.

At the same time, many industry experts believe the carmakers will eventually decide they must develop autonomous driving technology in-house, rather than licensing it from Silicon Valley providers. They note that as part of VW’s big bet on electric vehicles, it recently announced plans to enter battery production.

Seen that way, joint ventures such as Honda/GM and the expected Ford/VW deal are a variation on the early 1900s consolidation, which saw more successful carmakers buy parts suppliers.

“If [something] will be critical to the value of the car, I would suggest carmakers will want to control it,” says Ian Henry, of the AutoAnalysis consultancy. “If you have an automated car and it isn’t working you will blame the carmaker, because you don’t know who makes the software.”

In this view, Elon Musk may be ahead of the curve. Under him, Tesla has resolutely ploughed its own furrow on automation, rejecting the use of Lidar sensors and high-definition maps that most of its competitors rely on. Its go-it-alone attitude extends to the car’s body, which it has preferred to build from scratch rather than partner with a manufacturer. Although its high-end introductory models are cult favourites, the company has struggled to make a profit as it missed production targets for its mass market Model 3.

Waymo, Apple and Tesla are all trying to use self-driving technology to open a space for a fourth big US car company. But history suggests that’s a lot easier said than done. Why is a Waymo van the headliner? Idr any recent consolidation news from them Wait, are we pretending most companies were ever aiming for any exit other than an acquisition? I was really surprised when Aurora turned down an acquisition from Volkswagon. They are too small a player not to be acquired by a car company. Judging by Waymo and Cruises run rates, it likely costs something like $3-5b to  successfully roll out a product. It's always been obvious anyone without raising $1b and having at least 500 employees wasn't going to cross the finish line. Aurora has raised about $620M, Zoox $790M. Zoox is a terrible aquistion target because they wasted much of their money designing their own vehicle. Which is really an optimization to make after you've proved your core tech works. Aurora looks alot to me like cruise or argo, focused and backed by real talent, but they need a benefactor with deep pockets, and they really should be part of an org with deep pockets, if not a car company, I think Uber is best aligned to buying one of them. Pay wall.

But makes sense.  It’s not the tech it’s the data.  Which is why people are partnering with companies that have cars.",Self-driving car companies find that going it alone is difficult- Consolidation is sweeping through the sector

4. YMMV depending on make/model. The Volt is great, steering down to 7mph, full lateral and longitudinal control (must have ACC/radar)

5. OP can do odd things based on lead car and misreading Lane markings. Tar snakes are very bad and can cause unexpected Lane changes. I’ve had it for a year. Done multiple 100+ mile trips on the highway. Love it. I’m one of like three Lexus owners that I know of who use it. Works fantastic. I will say I keep longitudinal control in the car, EON only controls lateral (steering) for me. I've put a couple of thousand miles on mine in a Civic Hatchback. It's still an alpha product, in that it's fiddly and you have to watch for errors, but if you keep that in mind, it's great. Works best for highway driving - I've done 50+ miles at a time on a highway with no interaction. Works really well on Toyota Prius Prime since comma.ai added the new INDI control algorithm, and even better with the new model released in 0.6.

Huge improvement over the useless stock Toyota TSS-P lane keep assist system. LOOOOOVE it. I use it on my 2018 Volt. I use mine every day for 35mi commute each way on the ""wonderful"" 405 in SoCal. It really does make driving chill. I have a Prius Prime and just get in the carpool and I'm good until I need to exit. When I say ""I'm good."" that means I don't need to mess with braking or accelerating or steering for the most part unless some ding dong jumps in the lane. The car handles most everything. I can relax and listen to my podcasts or just count all the model 3 drivers sleeping in their car. The most recent update 0.6 is on par with Tesla for highway driving (excluding lane changing because it doesn't do that). 

&#x200B;

If you have a long commute and want to make the most of your time stuck in the car invest in the OpenPilot, it'll change your life. Go for it!  I've been using OpenPilot for over a year now and AutoPilot for about a month. I've made several cross country trips with OpenPilot. It's amazing.  

I've only made one six-hour trip using AutoPilot and I will say that I felt safer with OpenPilot. What's the cheapest used car you can buy that is supported? Use probably what is considered the lowest level of OpenPilot. No grey panda, no pedal, no custom fork. Even without these things it is still incredible and I use it on my 2017 Corolla every day. Has done over 1000 miles on a trip from NY to Florida non stop and it worked like a charm. It is getting better everyday and is the future. I’ve got about 8k miles with OpenPilot on my 2018 Accord Hybrid...am absolutely ecstatic. It handles long highway drives like a champ, and is a lifesaver on my daily 1 hr commute in stop and go traffic.

Best $ I have spent on an automotive upgrade, bar none.

One caveat, this is BETA tech. It works really well, but you have to be a tinkerer at heart to make it work.  Nothing crazy, just do your research, read the directions and come to the discord page if you have trouble...but this is far from a prime time product with robust customer support. I personally worry about the consequences liability-wise if you have an accident with this thing active. I'd buy it if it supported my car. (it does, but they don't sell the giraffe connector for it) There is a very dangerous capability where autonomy appears to be safe, but isn't. Your own life is in the hands of this thing and it looks capable, so it's very easy to trust it. It only takes one moment where it isn't capable and it will depend on you taking decisive action quick enough to save your life or someone else's life. There are even studies that show humans need to be paying attention for several seconds before taking over to be effective safety drivers.

A lot of this is also true about tesla and the othe ai programs out there, but the differences are: Tesla and Waymo have a lot more miles of testing. Tesla and Waymo restrict use to very strict cases (so far).

Be careful, and don't trust these until the risks are quantified and acceptable.

FWIW, I have worked on unmanned ground vehicles of one form or another for 14 years. I think it would be fun to tinker with, but not something I'd trust my life with or put on my daily driver.

If you are seriously interested in robotics and AI and the whole autonomous vehicle space, it seems like a good kit to poke around with and get some hands-on experience. But if your goal is to have your own self-driving car, you're deluding yourself if you think it'll be a turnkey solution that lets you take a nap while your car drives down the highway. How close do you guys think/feel they are to full self-driving? Really late to the party...

I look at [comma.ai](https://comma.ai) and see the kit much the same way I see something like [farmbot.io](https://farmbot.io) . It's a really cool idea, but you have to be willing to accept that it might just stop working, or go away completely, or cost you a lot more in time than it did money. With [comma.ai](https://comma.ai), the idea that I can add it to my car and get something that my manufacturer couldn't give me, is pretty awesome considering that the gap between my vehicle and a Model 3 is about $15k.   


Did you ever order the DevKit? so like can you watch a movie or read a book with openpilot?","What are your thoughts in the Comma.AI OpenPilot? I'm starting to consider to get a DEV KIT very soon. Its seem very promising in my opinion, and they just release a new version today."

So it was not that different than operating with a safety driver, although this is still an important step forward. Lead and chase vehicles? This really does seem like a hazard. Something a lot of people don't understand is that many loads will still need someone on board even if the truck is driving itself. A driver has a pretty long checklist of responsibilities on a trip and driving is only one of them. 

There's a whole lot of things a driver can do in the cab so there's not even any real need to remove them anyway. Tasks that brokers and sales people do in the office could be taken over by drivers. I can even see the possibility of drivers compensation being increased since they could be making commissions in addition to getting their normal drivers pay. 55 on the turnpike likely makes this truck a hazard to traffic Theoretically consumer prices should hit an all time low once AI assumes delivery responsibilities.

You can't have a crash or system problem. 

The requirements for SW robustness and Safety certification ASIL B/D are huge. (then add Security requirements and all of the testing)
Not to mention no one has any idea how to validate a release of these cars. Government or industry. It's mostly, 'we did our best'.

Or are you looking for the purely technical challenges? Verification.

Imagine that you've built a great self-driving system that turned out to be safer than a human.

Then one day you have to make a change for some reason. Maybe the vehicle code  had changed, maybe you've fixed some minor problem, or maybe you've added some minor feature. 

How do you verify your new system is safe?

The safety requirements are just crazy. Your car cannot be involved in a fatality more often than once in, say, 100 million miles. There are 100 lifetimes for an average driver. 

You can test. Testing is great, but it is not sufficient. It can test only a tiny number of cases, and especially with machine learning based systems, there's no good way of ensuring correctness at all.

I haven't even seen an outline of a solution to this problem. Edge cases.

As with everything AI, the easy part is the 90% of driving situations.  The hard part is that 10%.

Is there a stop sign?  Is the stoplight out? Is there sun glare making it hard to see the traffic light?  Is there a homeless guy trying to wash your windshield?

But it gets worse, Once you start accounting for the edge cases, you have to make sure your system isn't misclassifying things or situations.  Is that a construction worker coming to chat about the weather or is that a mugger trying to highjack your car?  Was that a plastic bag in the road or was that a kid that got away from their parent?

Those sorts of unpredictable events are what makes SDC really hard.  You can try to do a ""always stop if things look bad"" but that might make the car overly paranoid (in which case nobody will use the system).  On the flip side, the last thing any company wants is ""foo company car plowed through a bunch of kids on a field trip"".

This, IMO, is what's taking SDC so long.  It is also a hard enough problem that the engineers doing SDC research underestimated how much of a problem it is.   It is why telsa has been saying ""We'll have fully autonomous vehicles next year!"" since 2012.  The problem is massive and there aren't really any breakthroughs that I'm aware of.  It is just massive amounts of testing, collecting data, etc.

My prediction is that we are still at least 10 years away from a generally available consumer purchasable SDC solution. So, I know you said non political, but I’ll add real quick that everything is political. And one big one is this...when can blind/non-driving people/ drive? And what can help them drive?

I was able to drive before an illness caused me to lose vision enough to put away that steering wheel for good. My LHON began to affect me in 2012 and it took several months before I found that this was enough to take away driving from me. Not being able to drive was the most difficult thing in my life at that point. It never got easier. Having an appointment for my eye sight? Going to work? Going to just have any sort of thing I used to call fun? Nothing was allowed for me.

 I loved cars. I still do. Unfortunately having them as toys or helping people with their car problems was all I had. But technology progressed to have self driving be a possibility for someone like me, a legally blind individual to have hope. 

I believe in one: that people need to hear why people like me need self driving. For example, I am able to bike. I am able to walk to the store. To get what I need for myself. I have enough vision to get what I need to survive. But do you know what I can’t do? 

Lift a ～30 pound bag of dog food and bring it all the way home. 

I can’t get to the airport to visit my elderly parents. 

I can’t get supplies to fix my yard and my garden. 

I can’t fix the outside of my house to please my neighbors because they don’t care whether my eyes are fine or not. 

What I can do, and what goes with the subject of this post, is to talk to my neighbors and my friends. To tell them that innovation isn’t regression and that politics shouldn’t discourage the advancement in technologies. People like me shouldn’t be confined to their neighborhoods because they don’t have the luck that other people have. 

People are people. Some are born ahead. Some have privilege and some don’t. 

People not realizing that this technology is important will be the hardest part to overcome. I have fought tooth and nail to get people to realize this without telling them my personal issues. When I tell them of my vision they agree with me. But when they don’t know an individual who suffers because of the lack of ability of self transportation they could care less. 

I try so hard, but man, people having their own fun and cool cars will always out weigh my small attempts of freedom. 

The last time I drove was when I drove to the coast and prayed that it wouldn’t be the last time I could drive myself. I am actually an engineering student who is looking into a Master thesis related to self driving cars. Software reliability is out of the scope of my particular discipline of engineering (automation engineer here). I was looking into something related to computer vision. So far I see lane detection, object detection and SLAM as particular self driving obstacles that fall in the computer vision domain. If there are any other self driving obstacles that fall in the computer vision domain then please let me know If you haven't already, go watch Tesla's Autonomy Day presentation from last month. Lots of interesting details about challenges, and also highly technical.

A big challenge right now is weirdo vision cases. They cited an example of a bike strapped to the back of a car, and how vision needs to interpret that as a single object and not a phantom bike.

There's also edge cases like what happens at a stoplight when the stoplight is fully out and humans are doing their best to sloppily navigate through the intersection.

Tesla also appears to be having trouble developing parking lot Summon (they've promised and delayed it for a LONG time now).

So it seems to me that the ""single-direction on a highway with markers"" is mostly solved. The challenge now is figuring out scenarios where everyone has freedom to move/stop in their own way, e.g. parking lots and weird intersection scenarios.

One last area that I never see discussed is reading other drivers' queues. The number of times I've been saved (or helped) by watching where the other driver is looking (is their head turned away from me? are they texting?) or by accepting their ""wave through"" is countless. I wonder if FSD can/will have a mechanism for this.

To my last point, I'm expecting that while overall casualties will be much lower with FSD, the incidents that do happen will be because the car didn't pick up on queues from the other driver.

And what's interesting about THAT is that the FSD will probably be in the right, and there will be cameras that capture the video to prove it. Unfortunately someone will be hurt/dead because the car didn't avoid a situation that humans would have. Lawyers","What are some of the biggest challenges of self-driving technology? Obviously, being able to detect roads and the surroundings is one but what are others? For example, nowadays I hear work is being done to teach self-driving cars to predict the possible action another car or pedestrian might take. SLAM is also a big deal. But I was wondering what other (technical and not political/ social) obstacles are currently being researched on with regards to self-driving cars."

Also - pick you up from the pub. Collect your kids from school. Take you to the airport and then go home and park until you need picking up again. Or, whilst you're on holiday, the car becomes an automated taxi and earns money while you're away.

The future will be different. How about a car that can take over in case of an incapacitated driver. 

Think about a heart attack victim at the wheel, or someone having an epileptic seizure at the wheel, or someone falling asleep at the wheel, or a teen texting while driving, or an intoxicated person driving. 

Solving these simple usecases will save many times more lives. Tens of thousands of lives a year. 

An uber can take a sick person to a hospital today.

If you need to actually go to the hospital and not a normal doctors appointment, I don't think waiting 5 minutes at an unprotected left turn is the best choice. Hmm.

### From auto news authors:

- Talent shortage
- (CA?) DMV believes disengagements may not be best measurement of safety.
- Waymo Shift event in Mountain View demo'd Pacifica not Jaguar. Engineer in front seat still.
- Lyft partnership expanding this summer.

### From Krafcik himself

##### Trucking

- 90-95% commonality between driving Pacifica vs. semi
- Internal codename of truck project is ""husky""
- Started in Arizona area, pilot in March of 2018 in Atlanta moving things for Google sister company. Dock-to-dock, hub-to-hub.
- Going back to Phoenix to put a lot more miles on driving the Peterbilt.
- Driving semi on highway 'seems simpler', reality is you need to be prepare for same hazards as city street driving. Business aspects interesting, even now having a shortage of truck drivers.
- Trucking will now be based out of Phoenix.

##### Cars

- Lyft trial was a week or two ago for Krafkic himself personally.
- Waymo One users passed 1,000.
- ""enablers not disruptors"" -> Lyft really needs drivers and we can provide them.
- You'll see in Lyft opt-in to ""I am OK with self-driving car pickup"" with Waymo branding.
- Kicking off by the end of this month, first Lyft riders in Waymo cars end of month.
- Over time car ownership will reach a peak (not zero).
- Autonation services Waymo cars, want them to extend life of Pacificas through partnership. Autonation to apply knowledge to get 250,000+ miles out of Pacificas.
- Autonation with Avis acquires customers to be driven by Waymo.
- Discussions with OEMs going forward aiming for extrodinary miles from cars, far past 250k miles. Allows OEMs to focus on building reliable cars for Waymo.
- Future doesn't have to be electric, but does right now seem to be best bet. We're not a car company, we rely on OEM for propulsion technology.
- Pacifica was important because of electronic doors, on-board power.
- i-PACE has major upgrade in LIDAR and camera systems. 19 on todays car, even more on i-PACE. Help with edge-cases and long-tail distribution issues.
- LIDAR (some day talk more about), 90% of cost taken out of original Prius LIDAR. We've taken another significant step with 5th gen.
- Full-weather capable, wipers and sensor robustness against weather conditions. UP of Michigan. Good understanding of how challenging snow/ice is. Hardware getting ready, ML is being prepared.
- **1,000 Waymo One drivers, most of our riders have experienced a truly driverless experience**. Most of our rides still have safety driver, because we're being very thoughtful and very cautious as we roll out technology.
- Won't be ubiquitous in 4-5 years. Many Waymo options in Waymo-serviced cities, and substantial positions and mileage in trucking and logistics in many cities outside the US in 4-5 years.
- 60-70% statistic of Waymo riders are happy. We're delighting those users right now.
- We've driven 25 cities in US, and once in Italy (laugh). ""Italy was, uh??"" -> A gift for Sergio Marchionne, demo for Pacifica with Waymo driver and put 3 Pacifica on 747 flew them to Italy to drive all major SV investors around.

##### Other

- Detroit assembly plant is high-value, targeted products so less variation and problems stemming from it. ""From the time that we launched the Early Rider Program in 2017 to now, our driving capability has increased dramatically. **We're at a point now where we're very confident that we can drive safely**. What we want to make sure we  can do is also drive very comfortably in a way that engenders trust from our riders.""

""In 4-5 years if you're in a city that is serviced by the Waymo driver, you'll have all sorts of opportunity to experience a true driverless experience... we'll be in many cities including outside the US"" I’m confused though.  It says most of our riders have experienced driverless. 

However, I thought 100% of Waymo One rides have safety drivers, and only ERP have occasionally done driverless rides. I've about decided that listening to Krafcik is pointless.  At least with Elon I know to take what he says and double or triple the timeline and round off some corners.  Every time I listen to Krafcik I realize he didn't say anything of substance.  It sounds substantive but in reality there are a bunch of vague terms like ""ubiquitous"" which he never defines.  Everyone knows SDCs are here today in Phoenix and everyone knows it will be decades before they are in every city in the world.  What everyone wants to know is when they start being available to the public and roughly how fast they will expand to other major metros in the US.  He doesn't have to tell us but I also don't have to waste my time listening to him not tell me. >-Autonation services Waymo cars, want them to extend life of Pacificas through partnership.

If you want 250,000+ miles without major maintenance costs, you're going to need an EV.
I get why they are using the pacifica currently, but it seems odd to make such vague statements about type of cars they want for the future.
It's not just about the vehicle being able to do those numbers, its aboutnfull cost. It seems pretty obvious, that even at today's prices EVs have a better lifetime costs, especially at that kind of mileage.
What we're really waiting on is more body styles and options.

Does anyone make a full BEV minivan? or are they all still sedans and crossovers?

So in the case that Tesla got their core right enough to work like this, we may assume their edge case walls will break down around the same time horizon that 3-4 others do as well.

You check if the rate of killing is larger, equal or less by SDC in comparison with human drivers, if less or equal, you call it a success.

But it's way more profitable for the media to scaremonger. It’s going to happen.  But I don’t think it will happen until Waymo is at hundreds of millions of miles or over a billion miles.

Sure some people will freak out. But most people and regulators will look at the data, and realize the Waymos are by far the safest vehicles and know they need to move forward.

It won’t be “game over” it will be just the beginning.

If Waymo killed someone this year... with or without a safety driver... this would be a pretty big problem. What of a car kills somebody?

Oh wait it just happened. And again. And again. Don't blink, it just happened again. And a... well, you get the idea. It will be interesting to see how the public will react if the car does something really stupid and kills a person. 

Will people be rational and look at the data and realize all the people saved in other situations or freak out because e.g. a car killed a person on the sidewalk? We'll all pack up, go home, and this sub will get restricted, or whatever the admins call it now. When Waymo goes into full production most of us here expect its vehicles to kill people--but at a vastly lower rate than human driven cars kill people. In ten years Google/Waymo has caused one two-mile an hour fender bender with a bus, and even that was partly due to the stupid bus driver.

At least we know his bias.  Given that Toyota is about as far away from being ready for a driverless future, it makes sense that they have someone arguing the future is a long way off.

> few experts in autonomous cars believe that the technology is ready to safely chauffeur occupants in any and all driving conditions.

True, but ""some driving conditions"" is a huge market.

> And that’s before the regulatory hurdles

It's a small minority on the wrong side of history trying to hold back progress for a small number of special interests.  Overall the government in the US is all for driverless cars across both the previous Democratic administration as well as the current Republican one.  The hold up is simply a result of nothing can get through congress, even wildly popular legislation.  In the end it just delays the arrival of cheap autonomous cars, not the arrival of them completely. 

> including a quaint-seeming 1971 New York law that requires at least one hand on the wheel.

NYC will be the last major city to get self driving cars.  The same mentality is holding up legislation.  NYC is the least good example of what the future will hold I can think of.

> Global giants like General Motors, Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen are fully engaged in the self-driving race against the likes of Tesla, Uber and Waymo, a unit of Google’s parent company

The only names mentioned here that have made any real effort are GM, Tesla and Waymo. The rest are just smoke with no fire.  Of these three, they are all fully pushing forward which runs counter to the narrative of this article.

> But traditional automakers are also hitting the brakes, as premature promises run headlong into reality — what Mr. Pratt calls the current “trough of disillusionment” in autonomy.

False, GM is not hitting the brakes and they are a traditional auto maker.  The others are so far behind, they can just step out of the car without hitting the brakes since they are barely running at walking speed.  Not sure if Tesla is considered a ""traditional automaker"" but I consider them one since that is their business.  I think ""pure automaker"" is a better phrase that would encompass everyone and then you have two that are not hitting the brakes.

> A growing consensus holds that driver-free transport will begin with a trickle, not a flood.

I'm not sure anyone thought it would be a flood.  It's pretty obvious Waymo was going to launch in Chandler only so it was always a trickle as one market after the other came online.  I'm not sure anyone thought anyone other than Waymo would ever launch first.  I guess if Tesla does what they recently said it could be a flood, but again that runs counter to the narrative the article is providing that after consideration everyone is realizing  it won't be a flood given that Tesla just announced their flood plan recently.  Until then no one could have seriously suggested a flood and in my opinion still can't given the low chance Tesla has of delivering.

> Low-speed shuttles at airports or campuses may be the early norm, not Wild West taxi fleets through Times Square.

This is a fair point.  I don't think that's really a bad thing either and I look at it as a best first deploying quickly in a ""flood"" type manor.

Right or wrong I believe this study to be biased from the get go. The insurance industry that is going to be almost completely eliminated by self driving cars produced a negative study about a soon-to-be-self-driving car manufacturer?

Color me shocked. [removed] The public doesn't realize that Tesla's autopilot is more like [an autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot#Modern_autopilots) than an [autopilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrxyr1CjiSM). Meh, I don't really care too much about public perception of safety as much as I care about ""Is it safer than human drivers"". IHHS has real statistics, they do have aggregated data of Tesla just like they have data of all other manufacturers. Nobody forbids them to make a national study (parallel with  Highway Loss Data Institute of course). Some findings of misbehaving systems will be translated in corresponding stats and would make a very striking case against misbehaving Tesla. Of course if there is any problem with public perception. I’m pretty sure the public thinks driving in general is safer than it actually is. Well, they've been getting a bunch of videos of people on the highway asleep.. which is going to shape public perception.

Once you start seeing a bunch of videos presented of Tesla's crashing then perhaps that perception will change. “Tesla autopilot is safer than human drivers”. Release the data and start keeping more of your hard earned money in your pocket. They are spinning it the only way they can “people feel it is too safe and thus place themself at risk making it unsafe”. Lets see what they will sing when teslas double in numbers every year. What a dumb study. They asked people who had never used or read anything about the systems what they thought the capabilities of the system we're based on nothing more than the name of the system. 

But the beliefs of random people basically don't matter. What matters is how much the people who USE the system think it can do. Study funded by an interest group is implicitly bias. Doesn’t mean it’s trash, but it’s will be following a hypothesis that will get the team rehired. Not giving the participants the information they would receive before using each system is also going to skew results. Who cares what they think if they don’t drive the car in question and get the alerts!? Sure Autopilot sounds less hands on because of the association with hands off flying, but that’s not enough to trash Tesla. As self driving cars become the norm, the auto insurance industry will be much less lucrative than it is today.  Insurance will become a commodity, and possibly priced into the price of the car as variation between drivers approaches zero. The public probably also thinks that a human driven vehicle is safer than it is.

Is autopilot better than a human on average?  The bar is not high, and data I've seen so far says Teslas are about 4x beter in miles per crash.  This sounds like an insurance group gearing up to make excuses on continuing to charge current rates for insuring auto-driven vehicles.  Great. I would highly doubt the study has access to Tesla’s data.   Tesla has said often they don’t share the data because people pick and choose the dataset they want to tell the story they want. I will agree with this.

Down vote if you want but there are a lot of idiots who think autopilot means they can nap in the car while it’s moving.

There is a video a guy posted who tied a hand to the steering wheel Incase he nodded off and the car stayed on autopilot fine.","The public thinks Tesla’s Autopilot is safer than it is, an insurance group says "

&#x200B;

I'm trying to learn more about the forecasts for electric cars (bigger project on emissions/climate).  The numbers vary, but it seems like 20-30% of marketshare in the next 20 years \[[QZ](https://qz.com/1620614/electric-car-forecasts-are-all-over-the-map/)\]. 

&#x200B;

But there's also that interesting symbiosis of SDC's and EV's .. I've never quite heard it said directly, but I assume it's because the power demands of SDC's are more than you could get w a normal car battery (and then you'd need something else to turn gas to electricity, which would be efficiency losses .. so tl;dr not worth it w gas, right?) 

&#x200B;

So the question is really, can the momentum around SDC's work to increase the percentage of projected EV's on the road? Say for instance, we get them in 5 years, and you start to see bulk purchase orders from companies (lyft/uber), cities, etc –– do you think it could drastically affect the curve?",SelfDrivingCars,Question – can SDC's drastically affect the curve of EV adoption?,5," Yes.  This is how EVs will quickly become disruptive, when instead of 1 million cars serving 1 million customers, 1 million cars serving 8 million customers.    This is also how a fleet of 50m cars can provide transportation service for 90% of Americans and 50M cars can be manufactured within 3 years.  The convergence electric vehicles,  self driving technology, and fleet ownership will allow TAAS, especially TAAS pool to offer their service at a price point that is potentially 1/10th to the consumer of buying a brand new car.   This service won't get ALL consumers switched over to TAAS but enough of them to switch over that it would result in a cut in new car sales for that segment.    


For a fleet, especially a fleet doing local service within a city or within a metro area, Electric has some major advantages.  The cost per mile of electricity is drastically cheaper than gasoline or diesel.  Tesla advertises 4 miles per KWH, and right now a KWH costs about 12 cents, so 3 cents per mile.  If the fleet company uses solar to charge their cars they will get it down to 1 cent per mile energy cost.  In markets like California (which is the #1 car market in the country) Gasoline is $4 per gallon and rumored to go over $5 with the onset of new taxes.   Your car would have to get 400mpg to hit 1 cent per mile energy cost.  EVs also require far less maintenance than gas cars and are quieter and have a smoother ride.    For the Los Angeles market, A SDC fleet full of EVs competing against a SDC fleet full of gassers is going to have a huge competitive advantage and will be able to undercut on pricing.    


For the user there will likely be little or no commitment to signing up for a service.   Its not like the commitment required to buy a car.   You can sign up for Waymo and if GM Cruise offers a better price switch to them.   Maybe you have to pay a startup fee and monthly payment for some level of quality/service but there is no $40,000 loan for an item you intend to keep for a decade or more.     


  
Try as a thought experiment to think how you would want to run your cars as a fleet operator.  You would want to choose something that requires very little maintenance and can last for 500,000 miles or more.  You would want something that is easy to fuel with something that is not in shortage or needs to be imported and ideally you can generate on premises.     You are going to want something that can be very easily and cheaply cleaned daily and that is comfortable for your customers.  You aren't going to want to deal with fluctuating fuel prices or the infrastructure required to gas cars up.   You will want to make deals with local landowners to park and charge your fleet so your customers will have a Taxi that is very close to them should they need it (think churches who have parking lots that are empty 5-6 days a week). I would say that it is VERY likely that self driving taxis/shuttles will be electric. they're going to want to gradually displace taxis, buses and other transit. they're going to need the good PR of being ""green"". that, and lifecycle cost of electric cars are pretty competitive, even when up-front cost is higher. seems like a no-brainer to me. I don't think range will be a big deal, since peak time will need way more vehicles than off peak, so you'll only need all your vehicles for about an hour. after that, you can alternate which ones are deployed and which are charging The main thing isn't the power demand for the electronics (although that may be important too); it's the rate of depreciation of electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engine vehicles. The useful/economical lifetime of an EV is believed to be [around 500,000 miles](https://www.rethinkx.com/executive-summary) versus around 150,000 for an ICEV. Tesla is aiming for a [1 million mile](https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/) lifespan.

A robotaxi that can drive 3x or more miles before it needs to be retired is a better business proposition, even if the upfront cost is a bit higher. On a cost per mile basis, electric robotaxis will win. 

Moreover, the fact that electricity is cheaper than gas and that EVs theoretically need much less service and maintenance gives electric robotaxis an even lower cost per mile. If EV technology was awesome, EVs would have been adopted much more rapidly. If SDC tech was awesome, then certainly it would dramatically accelerate the rate of EV adoption, but SDC tech isn't awesome either. Like EV tech, it's just barely, and I expect the path to widespread deployment to be long and winding. I disagree. A company like Uber will want to keep their car on the road as much as possible.

You can get a gas tank that gets you 500 miles and takes 5 minutes to fill.

An EV gets you 200 miles and requires an hour to fill. 

Thats why public transit in the US has been so slow to move to EV. I cant recall which one, but one city sent back all their electric buses because they couldnt make it the full day of service as promised when they bought them. I do not understand why SDC are bundled with EV.  ""But there's also that interesting symbiosis of SDC's and EV's""

It's more than just interesting, it's the whole ball of wax. EV's make little sense to the avg Joe but they do make sense to a self-driving taxi company.

that said, we make all kinds of changes to roads/intersections where humans have a hard time navigating (reflectors, painted lines, arrows, lights, etc.). I'm not sure why we wouldn't modify infrastructure that is difficult for robots to navigate. I think the roads themselves are less of an issue than the other cars,people,etc.   hence why divided highways are already navigate-able by a lot of “autopilot” systems like Tesla, gm super cruise, etc. Roads being designed for SDCs has some interesting prospects  regarding traffic management --- perhaps develop some standardized mechanisms for signal-ling to SDCs.

Also:  instead of having each vehicle plan its own route -- it would be very interesting to have each vehicle contact a central municipal computer to  ""schedule""  its route;   the central computer could then plan its exact  path and timing of travel  similar to  the  routing of trains   that has to be approved by a central authority for traffic management.

The central authority could then schedule different vehicles onto different routes in order to  maximize the utilization of various roads for the shortest average travel times for the cars as a whole while minimizing traffic conflicts and congestion.

And using controlled speed variation  to compensate for route delays such as pedestrian interference, etc.

By having a central authority route each vehicle and say WHEN each vehicle is to be where  on their route at a given time ---  aside from maintaining efficient traffic control,  they can also provide  timings  so vehicles arrive at each intersection when the light is green.

The majority of ALL passenger miles or of ride sharing miles?
Of ALL miles? no chance in that timeframe.

People won't give up their personal vehicles that easy. Sure mobility will replace 2nd vehicles for many families and even some primary vehilces for some people if the price is right, but it's hard to replace the versatility of owning your own vehicle. Especially if you need to say, leave phoenix to visit a friend or go on vacation.

Disruption will occur, but ""majority of passenger miles in Phoenix within 5 years"" seems completely unrealistic. maybe 15 years...
How many Waymos would you need to accomplish that? Let's see the math. Can Waymo even put that number on the street in 5 years?

In the meantime you will need charging networks for the very real sharp rise in EV sales. Also, aren't there 200 new EV models coming to the market by 2022. That's jsut three years away.
I think you're underestimating how many non SDC EVs will be sold in the next 5 years. They will need charging infrastructure.

I don't get it. I am dumb. This makes it should like they’ve only driven 360 miles in semi-autonomous mode across the fleet. I have a hard time believing this is a real ad. The 360 miles might refer to the range of the fuel cell clarity (366 epa miles). The corner has a logo of the fuel cell car and the asterisk comment speaks about milage. I guess the ad is confusing because it's an attempt to show how Honda are advanced by showing their investments without a real useful product to back it. This image doesn't exist anywhere else on the internet. It's confusing and poorly written because it's not actually an ad by Honda. Why would you even make this advertisement?

The H2 logo is a clever idea but that’s my favourite part of the whole thing. 

Hydrogen is a fool’s errand in my opinion. That ad design is straight out of the 90s. Given that all cars currently require hands on wheels and full attention anyway, honestly it's a decent selling point if it doesn't look ugly.

Did he really say that about inclement weather?  I know he has said they may never get to L5, but that isn't the same thing. I dislike the title of the article, I think it conveys the wrong message.

But I do agree with the point of the article.

More and more human driven vehicles with ADAS that will make them much much safer than L0 cars, however not as safe as a fully driverless car.

Decluttered version of this Slate Magazine's article archived on June 13, 2019 can be viewed on https://outline.com/zYvjBd So was he deluded or scamming when he was at Google? I heard him say 2016 at MIT that he did not think his pre-teen would need a drivers licence. Does he just need to make more careful statements as a corporate officer than as an engineer? No need to read beyond the tagline: ""Chris Urmson, who helped pioneer the technology at Google before founding Aurora, says it could be 50 years before we see them everywhere.""

Well, even conventional cars aren't *everywhere*, so it means nothing to speculate about when self-driving cars will be everywhere.

Also, no one can predict 50 years into the future. We're only ~10 years into smartphones and only ~20 years past dial up modems. Trying to say something will happen in 50 years has near-certain probability of being wrong.

I feel like all the speculation around this field is driven by interests. Companies that are behind & needing to catch up or want to cool down the competition are going to say these are far away. People who depend on things staying the way they are or who are simply scared of this technology will spread FUD.

I think Tesla might surprise everyone, but let's pretend you're a Tesla skeptic. The project Waymo originated from is barely more than 10 years old. Do we really think that given a clear path, it's going to take them another 50 years to scale it to anywhere that matters? It's a different challenge, but think about how quickly Uber scaled. Waymo has to do hardware, so it'll take longer, but not 50 years.","Interview with Chris Urmson: How Close Are We to Self-Driving Cars, Really? "

This is a perfect example of where the DMS system that Tesla doesn’t believe is necessary should be absolutely necessary Driver was obviously in the wrong here, but the commentary from the person who recorded the video is incorrect. He said that if the thing tied around the wheel fell off it would hit the car in front of it going 60-65 MPH. This statement is wrong on so many levels and I think it's one of the reasons that people have an issue accepting self driving cars. Personally, if I passed out (against my will, not willingly) I'd rather my car slow down and stop even if it is on a highway, rather than keep going (which is what AP does) These people are actually HEROS!! Risking their lives testing and pushing the limits of unproven tech. Every great technological breakthrough have had their fair share of sacrifices. There are two narratives here:

* Lane assist leads to irresponsible drivers who take their eyes of the road for prolonged periods of time, endangering themselves and everyone around them. We must figure out how to stop these jackasses.
* Lane assist avoids accidents as sleep deprived or even intoxicated drivers who would otherwise cause fatal accidents drive home safely.

I honestly don't know which one of these happens more often, or how to figure out the answer to that question. But I feel that it's quite important.

Both due to functionally increases and our ability to focus on them.

Why would I use that dirty, slow, unreliable screen in my robot taxi instead of the one I carry with me, does all the stuff I want and I can carry anywhere?  I don’t doubt that these screens will exist, but I see people trying them and dismissing them.  Then passengers will just request that their robo taxi just provide a large screen to project content from a passenger’s personal device. All I'm thinking is, ""fuck, there are going to be ads everywhere..."" Imagine not having to be confined to only playing monopoly in the home  Or not.   People will use the same device they use in Ubers, in the back of cars, on trains, on planes -- their phone or tablet.  They don't really want an ""in car experience"" that is different than what they already like and configured.   They will want a big screen to toss shows up on from their phone, but that's all it will be, a screen for the phone. >The first screen that really mattered was the cinema. Then came television, computer screens, and smartphones

I'm not sure that a car's screen counts as its own thing, really. Modern TVs have OSes and apps, so they're basically just immovable tablets with ATSC/QAM tuners in them, and tablets are just large phones without SIM slots. Once laws allow drivers to stop monitoring car behavior. Just give me a local wifi network I can join and a thing I can cast to, and I'm golden. Does nobody else feel sick when they read in the car?

Being able to sleep or have a drink would be great, or just generally not have the stress of driving, but I feel sick after about 10 minutes of looking at my phone in a car. Or people will use their phones... I would be napping, honestly. And now you know why Apple and Google want to make cars...

Very rarely is a single engineer “key”. If so, then it is good to get rid of them quickly if they are not enabling the organization to take on their function. “Key” engineers are damaging to organizations. Good engineers are ones worth keeping. They try to eliminate their job function. Those who are successful at this are worth their high salaries because they bring up the whole organization.

Personal owned cars will become much more useful and valuable with self-driving, not less. This plays into my fears of SDC and how it might lead to people accepting way longer commutes because they could sleep/work/whatever during their commute, leading to more congestion and more pollution.

And, on top of that, this will lead to a lot of solo, long distant car trips, which would also cause more pollution than a decently full mid-sized plane... and **WAY** worse than a bus.

Why would anyone take a bus when, if you own your car, the price of gas would be so small for a long trip that the convenience of being able to go when you want and having privacy would encourage almost everyone to take this option? So, hyper loop/bullet trains, or nah?

Flying is an expensive and miserable experience that’s only made worse by government and industry.  Many people (myself included) would rather drive 1,000 miles in ~16 hours than fly to the same destination in a few.  Bonus points for sightseeing, and pulling over to take photos. Hotels like Hampton Inn and regionals will both be devastated. 

Assume 90mph. I can watch a movie while eating 2h, sleep 8h, eat breakfast and news 1h, and now I need a place to shave and shower. 

That is 11h at 90mph or 990 miles. That will take you from Wall Street NYC, well into Canada, to St Louis, or to Jacksonville. 

So, also assuming the car is comfortable enough to nicely sleep in you are all set for door to door travel without the rapey touching of the TSA, or the annoying check in, blah blah of a on-the-road hotel stay. This is a lazy article. Assume something will happen and write about repercussions is just fiction. Driverless cars in 2030 ... airlines have a good chunk of time to figure this out I have already beta tested driving versus plane + hire car, and having a better long distance touring car will make the driving option increasingly more attractive.

My long distance drives are ~2000km each way. Breakeven in dollar terms is one person flying and hiring a car for one week. When two of us are travelling together there is no competition. It’s possible that SDC will allow for much higher speeds so the average speed on the highway could become 150-180 kph on highways. High speed trains would be much better. Combine that with something like Boring Company high speed tunnels, and air travel will feel the pain.

Jalopnik [reported](https://jalopnik.com/californias-autonomous-car-reports-are-the-best-in-the-1822606953) about one 2016 incident that Cruise claimed was not a *qualifying disengagement*. It quotes [Amir Efrati from The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cruises-self-driving-cars-may-not-be-as-smart-as-they-appear) about that ~~incident~~ disengagement report:

> For instance, Cruise said in the report that its cars drove nearly 2,300 miles in San Francisco in November 2016 and experienced only six “qualifying disengagements.” (Cruise declined to say what it means by “qualifying.”) One of the people who’s been involved with Cruise’s testing in that period said, however, **it was normal for one car to experience four or five safety-related disengagements every couple of hours, in just several dozen miles’ worth of driving**. The same can be said about Cruise’s car tests at the beginning of this year, this person said.

> And in the report, Cruise listed only disengagements from what it called “planned tests.”

Their disengagement reports seem somewhat *cough* aspirational *cough*. Where are the regulators? I would not say yay to federal regulators developing the safety standards.  The problem is that even the industry experts don't yet know how to define metrics and tests.  Once they have figured that out and it has matured for a few years (or usually, historically, decades) it can be time for regulators to write standards.   Regulators never write standards for technology that is not yet even deployed yet, nor should they.

However, regulators can write down goals, like ASIL-D reliability levels, without saying a lot about how to go about it.  However, even that is risky, because we don't know what is write to measure.  When we ask regulators to come up with even basic rules early in the game, they decide to track things like disengagements.

As for simulated testing being less yay, while real testing is necessary, simulation is the only place you can test what really matters, namely performance in risky situations.  Real world testing teaches you what to put in your simulator, and it helps you test perception because perception does need real world data to test.",Summary of The Information's article about GM Cruise

1. $200/million a quarter run rate for Cruise
2. 43 million miles minimum miles driven to have confidence in safety.
3. 1 million miles per month. The rate Waymo is driving

Now we can make some assumptions

1. Waymo is driving much more than Cruise, so I'd assume thier run rate is much higher. say 50% or 300 million. 
2. They've also driven about 20 million miles. so 23 million more to go
3. So they'll need 2 years, and $2.4 billion before confidently releasing a product.

Conclusions

1. Small companies really can't compete given the capital requirements to build their product, unless they can figure out how to do it much more cheaply. Or raise so much more capital. 
2. A reasonable product is at least 2 years away for Waymo, probably more for Cruise/Argo.
3. This is probably optimistic, because you really need 43 million miles from when you think you're safe, not 43 million miles total
4. Still I wouldn't expect to be able for the general public to use an SDC until 2022 at the earliest.",SelfDrivingCars,Important Numbers,2," It’s difficult to do this math when you are estimating technology advancements.  I work for a company in the technology sector and we frequently license technology which leaps us forward, sometimes even from competitors.  

Also, when you do business with MoblEye, Nvidia or other suppliers you also get a fair amount of their investments to start from.  Meaning some of what you have to pay to research and develop today comes at a much lower cost in a few months.

In the end, you can say it’s really pricey, but no one can estimate how much it takes to start one of these businesses like they are franchises.

Apple may spend $8 Billion and end up with nothing.  Zoox may only spend $2B and have a competitive taxi for San Francisco in a couple years. Anything can happen.  Waymo's plan for 80,000 cars would allow them to get 15M miles per day if they averaged 200 miles each.  We can have a billion miles on the system within a few months.  That could allow them to very rapidly improve their system to allow for some very quick rollout.    


My prediction is that we will see some marketplace open to the public for some rides in 2021.  It won't be main stream, it may only be in a few cities along select routes but if you are in that city and along that route you can use it with some minimal signup effort (you will probably have to pay though) but in 2022 they are going to be in deployment mode.    


How it happens over the next 2-5 years is still sort of grey, but I think it will be finished by 2030. A far more important non-number: Self-driving is an open scientific and engineering problem. Nobody knows, when, or if, it will be solved.

Also, 80% confidence is not high confidence. You can't publish a scientific paper in any self-respecting conference or journal with 80% confidence - you'd be laughed out of the room. Statistical significance is usually defined as 95% confidence, which will require many more miles to be driven. Thanks for the recap! Where did the 43 million miles for safety come from? The amount of driving you are doing is not necessarily a sign of your burn rate.    Driving is costly, but not the main cost.

But yes, this is an expensive thing to do.   That doesn't scare startups, because several of them have made bundles selling to the big companies who hope to get a speed boost.","Important Numbers From the last few posts I noticed a few numbers I thought were important, because they could be used to estimate how much it'll take to get to autonomy.

But all the systems are in early stages of development and so the metrics would be very confusing. A low incident rate might mean they are getting really good at driving... or merely that they aren't doing anything difficult. > But to be clear, more than 3 years prior, Google/Waymo was far surpassing what the leaks say about Cruise, and the difficulty of SF streets seems not nearly enough to account for that.

I'm not too sure about that. The vast majority of Waymo's miles at the time were on the highway. They could rack of tons of miles simply by staying in their lane. You could drive for miles on a highway and not even encounter another car or any obstacle.

Compare that to the streets of SF where almost every street will have someone double-parked, there are tons of stop signs and stoplights, unprotected left turns, bicyclists, pedestrians, etc. There's a lot more involved than just staying between painted lines while maintaining speed and not wrecking into the thing in front of you.

I'm guessing the author never had the displeasure of driving on SF's surface streets. > Even before the government might mandate better metrics, it is time for teams that want to be considered leading teams to step forward and start doing this...I'm looking at you -- Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Ford/Argo, Aptiv, MobilEye, Uber, Lyft and Tesla and maybe a few other automakers like VW/Audi and Daimler. We need these numbers to judge you. A demo ride doesn't let me judge a car, and I know a lot about what to look for. Press releases and partnerships don't. It's time to open the curtain a bit.

Here, here!

However, I think the unfortunate truth of the matter is, while it is frustrating for someone that follows this space closely to not have access to these numbers, the average person probably doesn't care at all.  So there isn't a lot of incentive to publicly release them.  I don't think Waymo or anyone cares what the few thousand Redditors here think.  In [fill in number] years, when they have an actual product to sell to the masses, then we'll get some assurances on safety, without airing their dirty laundry on the current, less attractive development period. I'm not sure how you can directly compare leaked metrics from two different companies operating in two different ways. Within a company, metrics can show relative improvement, but I don't know if it's a given metric means the same thing to both Cruise and Waymo If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Waymo hasn't hit anything in 10 yrs. Ok yeah, a fender bender with a bus that was questionably their fault. If Cruise isn't hitting anything then I don't see the problem. It's their money. I get a kick out of these articles that discuss Waymo's huge lead as if other companies should just stop, quit, go home and wave the white flag. I guess since someone did something first they get dibs on 100% of the market share. To everyone involved, employed, interested, invested in any company that isn't Waymo...keep on going! I highly suspect the old auto companies are at best hoping to build up enough patents that they can cross licence with the other old auto companies and then make a cartel ""cross licencing"" offer to the Waymos of the world.

There is no way a company with a pile of engineers with ""seniority"" can do self driving cars, and there is no way they will let a bunch of upstarts youngins drive the future of the company. 

Think Kodak and the digital camera. Yes they saw it as the future, but they didn't act on it like they believed it. I suspect the guy in charge of digital cameras would be sitting on millions in revenue at best and be out shouted by the guy with 100's of millions of revenue in the traditional film department. Waymo has been the most transparent. It's comical to think that other companies are just as close. Waymo has a 3 lap lead in a four lap race. Why? They all have a long ways to go. The CNNs operate nothing like brains. They will get there, but will take years. Nice thing is 10 years from now it will be standard on new cars sold.

> The idea is to reduce congestion through fleet management..

Good luck.  For any given number of miles you can certainly do this but overall because it will be easy and cheap to use and the governments won't regulate them, it will increase congestion.  By regulation I mean incentivizing pooled rides through higher taxes or other disincentives on solo rides.

This is what I have (I still had the article open in a browser tab)

**FCA US announces partnership with autonomous start-up Aurora days after scrapping Renault merger**

FCA US, the North American arm of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, is forming a partnership with autonomous vehicle partnership with start-up Aurora which already has linked up with retail giant Amazon.

The announcement comes just days after the automaker’s parent company broke off talks with Groupe Renault, a proposed “merger-of-equals” with which it hoped to gain access to the self-driving technology being developed by French automaker’s Japanese alliance partner Nissan. Fiat Chrysler has long dragged its feet on developing the self-driving vehicles that many industry observers expect to become commonplace over the next couple decades.

“As part of FCA’s autonomous vehicle strategy, we will continue to work with strategic partners to address the needs of customers in a rapidly changing industry,” said Mike Manley, Chief Executive Officer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. “Aurora brings a unique skillset combined with advanced and purposeful technology that complements and enhances our approach to self-driving.”

Aurora, which employs over 200 at offices in Pittsburgh, Palo Alto and San Francisco, is led by CEO Chris Urmson who was one of the pioneers in the autonomous field and led a project set up by Google until around the time it was spun off as Waymo.

Neither Aurora nor FCA US would reveal financial details of their new partnership, but the start-up got fresh funding of more than $530 million earlier this year, with Amazon a leader in the Series B funding round. The retail giant has made several strategic investments over the past year, several focusing on autonomous technology, another giving it a stake in Rivian, an electric vehicle start-up based in suburban Detroit. Analysts have speculated Amazon is hoping to build a fleet of self-driving delivery vehicles.

For its part, FCA said in a statement that it has turned to Aurora to help it develop self-driving commercial vehicles which “would allow for a variety of customized solutions for commercial vehicle customers at a time when changing lifestyles and online shopping patterns are creating logistical opportunities.”

That suggests a broad range of potential options including self-driving ride-sharing vehicles – such as the ones that the new Waymo One service is fielding in the Phoenix suburbs, as well as driverless delivery trucks.

The connection to Aurora could give FCA a direct connection to Amazon. But, in the strange-bedfellows world of high-tech transportation, Amazon’s stake in Rivian also connects it to Ford Motor Co. which invested $500 million in that start-up in April.

Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler has also partnered with Waymo, becoming one of the lead vehicle suppliers to its ride-sharing service. Waymo One has plans to purchase more than 60,000 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans and modify them at a new plant outside Detroit.

Whatever the long-range goal, analysts like Sam Abuelsamid, of Navigant Research, have until now faulted the Italian-American automaker for its go-slow approach to autonomous vehicle research. It has only made marginal efforts on its own. One of the potential benefits it cited for a merger with Renault was to be the access that provided to the autonomous and electrified vehicle technologies being developed by the French automaker and its ally Nissan.

“We are thrilled to forge a partnership with FCA US to develop a meaningful business model for delivering the benefits of self-driving commercial vehicles,” said Sterling Anderson, Aurora Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.

Joint ventures are becoming a norm, rather than the exception in the increasingly high-tech automotive world. Early this year, Honda signed on as an investor in General Motors’ Cruise Automation subsidiary. They also are partnered on a fuel-cell project. This week, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover launched a partnership focused on battery-car technology, while Toyota and Subaru announced plans to jointly develop a new battery-electric vehicle platform. It sounds like FCA has decided they have no future other than being a Tier 1 supplier to tech companies. 

A huge blow for the company. Their best days are clearly behind them. This is a great move for FCA. I presume that they'll be Aurora's supplier of vehicles in the same manner they supply Waymo. They should've learned a lot working with Waymo that they can offer them. 
  
On the other hand, they could be planning on operating their own service and flipping the bird to Waymo, in which case the much vaunted 60k order is at even greater risk of fulfillment... FCA and Aurora will develop autonomous cars, powered by Google/Waymo software calling it now. 
Google should want Waymo to be the Android of the auto industry Waymo and Aurora will have most of the market.",FCA US announces partnership with autonomous start-up Aurora days after scrapping Renault merger

They were looking really good up until Andrew Ng took over, following his departure as head of AI at Baidu. Drive.ai has some real talent working for them, it makes sense for someone like Apple to be sizing them up. They were acquired weeks ago. Last I heard, their Mountain View office is practically empty. Strange acquisition considering Apple laying off “hundreds” from its own self driving project earlier this year.  Perhaps shedding of “less skilled” employees in anticipation of this acquisition?  Still seems odd to me. $999 shuttle rides! I think the next couple years will see the start of consolidation. the music stops on the game of musical chairs as soon as one company starts to roll out widely. everyone is happily developing away since there is no pressure to go commercial, but markets like this don't tend to support 20 different products. I believe Tesla will try to roll out in the next couple of years, ready or not, and maybe Waymo, so everyone else will have to scramble to get market-share or be left out. that will mean the dozens of companies will have to whittle down to 3-5. some of that may be bankruptcy but most will be merger. the companies with some unique skill will do best in mergers. I thin Tesla has a real big advantage in that realm; they can get live feedback from their drivers, and pull training data from the fleet at will. that is valuable, even if their NN+cameras aren't very good compared to mapping+lidar competitors. I find it interesting that a company like Apple needs a company like [Drive.ai](https://Drive.ai). I mean I guess I was thinking, hey this is Apple, they have experts in everything. But they don't. I think what this shows is just how small the talent pool is in autonomous cars and how valuable these top tier guys are. Really doubt Tesla will roll it out massively in the next few years, especially bypass Waymo’s operation. Yes, they do have access to a large amount of data, but how to sort through the massive amount of data and only extract the useful data is extremely difficult. Moreover, data has expiration date as well. Once they pass the expiration date, you still need more data, especially the corner cases/ long tail scenarios to train your algorithms.

Ah... Man made self driving vehicles vs. organic self driving vehicles!  Who will win?

Also, let's say Jacob is passed out drunk in the buggy, while on the way home gets pulled over.  Is that a DUI?  What if the horse was drunk but Jacob was sober... Is that cool? Hopefully they open to the public soon, because this feels like a tactic to give the illusion of progress.  There are millions of staged tests they could conduct as they prep for rollout.

I’d like to see a Waymo with an empty driver’s seat:

-	Navigate a crowded Costco parking lot.
-	Recognize an accident and conduct a u-turn at the intersection prior to the accident
-	Merge onto and off of a busy freeway
-	Recognize and avoiding a flooded road

These experiments with horses seem valuable, but could de conducted anywhere. What was the deal with giving the horse two car widths?  Those vans don’t give bicyclists that much space. I think because of the 90-9-1 problem, they are probably going wide before going deep on edge cases. Think of it like this 90% of the solution takes the same time as the next 9% which takes the same amount of time as the last 1%. So getting 90% of the interaction with horses down, is pretty easy, and really lowers your total intervention rate.

An intervention required because of a tricky horse problem might happen now 1-10 times they deal with horse, but horses might only be present on 1-in-1000 trips, meaning getting 90% of the way means you'll only need to intervene because of horse 1-in-10000 trips. That's pretty good. 

In the last 1% I'd guess you'd go wide on edge cases getting as far along as possible, on as many as possible, rather than completely mastering any case. Then you'll go through these edge cases again based on frequency. 

This really highlights to me why this Problem is so hard. In AI there is the learning transfer problem. An AI that learned to play chess isn't automatically better than a blank AI at GO. Where as a human who has mastered one strategy game can make use of the learnings in the next one.

That should be pretty damn easy to implement, and all the hardware to do so is already in the car.

I would be surprised if this was true.

You don’t need a sensor in the driver seat to decide if the driver is present and needs to put a seatbelt on. Self driving cars aside, there is always a driver. Autopilot automatically disengages if you leave the drivers seat or unbuckle the seatbelt. Anyone who's used autopilot and tried to sit up for a second or remove the seatbelt to take off a jacket will know how that goes. _Extreme_ alpha testing. wait? doesn't auto pilot know if the diver is in the seat?

Uh.... I know the author thinks they are making a dramatic point... but a fifth autopilot fatality isn't ""all but inevitable"".   It is absolutely inevitable.

&#x200B;

Neither the claim nor the standard is ""completely foolproof, never have an accident"".   The standard should be ""is safer than driving without it.""   And I don't think we have enough information to know the answer to that - so that is the only decent point the author makes.

Actually, with all the data they collect, Tesla may be able to answer that question by comparing miles driven in similar circumstances by human drivers with miles driven by autopilot.  So compare California freeway miles with California freeway miles, for example.  There should be some statistically significant data available in their most densely populated areas like California and South Florida.  And they should be able to tease out all accidents instead of the much rarer fatalities. The deaths per miles driven metric for humans includes all forms of driving (highway, city, suburb). human driving deaths per highway mile driven is likely to be much better than other roads. So autopilot is probably less safe than human driving as it is done exclusively on highways.

The key thing is that Elon musk knows this yet still touts the safety metric as if it’s an apples to apples comparison.

Is this trivial or obvious?",SelfDrivingCars,Four lane highway lane use,4," Random thoughts...

Your philosophy may make sense, but in CA, where most of the AV prototypes are being tested, it’s not illegal to cruise in the left lane on a highway. It is illegal to do so in other states though, such as Washington. The fact that there are different laws in different states must mean that there is some debate about the efficiency etc. though right?

Most developers are working on geofenced L4 currently, so I assume they will take into account local laws. If your question is whether they will take into account your philosophy even in places where it is not the law, I don’t know.

Also, many of the L4 robotaxis will initially start out in dense urban centers. The point at which a significant portion of highway traffic is consistently made up of AVs (compared to human driven cars), and could therefore make an impact like you are suggesting, is likely many years away (10+). On the one hand, developers are focused, correctly, on getting the car to drive safely and reliably as task #1, and patterns of traffic are definitely a lower priority.  They will be dealt with in more detail later.

Because of task #1, many developers certainly want their car to avoid riding in the right lane with all its merges. Of course, if they have decided their car must never exceed the speed limit, they may be required to ride there due to the general rule of slower traffic keep right.

It is only once they get clearance to travel above the limit, as is usually the case in non-right lanes, that they can think about that.   In some places, which set limits to not have everybody speed, they can think about it today.

At the low level, robocars will tend to not want to change lanes as much.   Once your passenger is reading e-mail, they are not usually so eager to constantly change to save a small amount of time the way human drivers like to do.    They'll pick the lane that's moving at the speed they want to travel, and stick to it unless somebody has entered that lane who wants to go much more slowly than it is going.  Which won't be another robot.","Four lane highway lane use Perhaps this is too esoteric but I think its a topic with serious ramifications for how Interstates work, at the very least.

With inches to spare, I swerved into the unoccupied left lane and narrowly avoided an accident. Concurrently, in that split second, I saw the Model 3’s driver’s hands jump from his lap to the wheel and yank it to the right. The car was on Autopilot.

I don't want to completely dismiss this guy's article, but the whole thing is based on an assumption that the car was on autopilot? We don't know that for a fact though. Author's concerns are valid but the driver could have been texting with his phone in his lap under manual control for all we know. >Neither she nor you signed Tesla’s Autopilot Terms and Conditions.

Some day, your daughter is going to learn to drive, and nobody else on the road signed up to be in that beta test either. Heck, she may well kill someone. It's at least a risk. Teenagers are statistically much more dangerous than the average driver. 

We accept that risk because it's the only way for people to become good drivers. The difference here is that if robots get good at it, instead of one good driver, we'll have billions. The reality is that it makes for a good story when the original poster says, Tesla’s autopilot feature almost killed my family. Instead of saying that an individual driving a Tesla almost caused a collision. Just as a side note: the child’s life is at risk anytime she is in the car, due to the unpredictable nature of life in general. Hmm this seems disingenuous to assume autopilot was the culprit here. It’s unlikely that autopilot would lane change into another vehicle due to the redundancy in sensors. Even if the optical sensors hadn’t seen OP’s vehicle the ultrasonic sensors would have. I’m not saying AP is perfect, because it’s not. But in this scenario I would expect AP to perform well. 

A more likely explanation is that the M3 driver was not paying attention and jerked the wheel from distracted driving without AP involved. 

I am also skeptical by the way this is written and its timing...Tesla AP is a hot topic and claiming it almost killed your happy singing family but was saved by OP’s super human like reaction timing is odd and strikes me as a way to get article views. I mentioned the timing of this article as AP has recently been shown to save an unknowing M3 driver in a similar fashion as the family described in the article. 

Not calling OP a lair, as autopilot does fail. I am just skeptical of the intentions of this article. lol I shouldnt be a variable in a teenager's driving lessons, but I see those ""L"" signs on the road all the time... life will never be completely free of risk man, but autopilot could help make us MUCH safer on the road. Worth a try right? If we are looking to save lives we should more heavily regulate the largest contributor to traffic fatalities, the drivers.

how I imagine it:

a truck autonomously drives 1000 miles, but as it approaches the delivery city, it pulls into a rest stop/weigh station/etc. and a human checks it over, makes sure the truck and cargo are good, then drives it the last 5 miles into the difficult city streets to make the delivery and deal with the people on the receiving dock (hell, they might even work for the receiving dock). 1 driver would be able to do \~10 trucks a day; instead of taking 10 drivers each 2 days to make the journey. kind of like tug boats for a ship, helping make the last difficult part of the journey

&#x200B;

also note, with driver costs removed, a cargo van is about 1/10th the cost and 1/10th the capacity. so cargo that can be split into small batches might just be put into a bunch of vans, which would be WAY easier to navigate through tight areas, and WAY less disruptive to traffic. especially the kinds of deliveries (like grocery stores) where one truck makes rounds to multiple locations. it would be way easier to send 1-2 vans to each store than drive one truck through tight roads.

However, when GM is both the manufacturer and the customer, in case of the Chevy Bolt/Cruise AV, they have every incentive to make the cars as bulletproof as possible.",SelfDrivingCars,Will planned obsolescence become obsolete in the era of robotaxis?,14," I just want to say that THESE are the types of conversations around SDCs I find fascinating. There's no such thing as 'planned obsolescence'.  But if anything, I'd expect it to accelerate in a hypothetical ""robotaxi"" era as manufacturer support will be required for all cars, and manufacturers will deliberately 'sunset' models 5-10 years after they're released, rending the robotaxi essentially an expensive paper weight. This is mostly true, but there is one counter force.   Old computers are obsolete even when they still work fully to spec.  As the car becomes more and more a computer, it faces that issue.   You don't want to get into a 10 year old taxi with 500,000 miles on it.  Or you will certainly not pay as much for that.

So you definitely won't pay double to double the life of a car.  Possibly not even 50% more. My hope would be that, since they'll likely shift to being fleet-owned, they would be designed for recyclability and reuse instead of obsolescence. There will *absolutely* always be incentives to ride in the newest cars, meaning the cycle could actually get faster (in my opinion). Safety, comfort, etc., will make people want to ride in the newest possible models. GM still has an incentive to obsolete vehicles sooner than Waymo. The problem is stranded assets. They now produce 10 million vehicles per year. But in an SDC world they don't need to build so many. In the short run making more cars might be cheaper than making them last longer. Eventually they'll have to close factories and this will change but in the short run there are too many car building factories, and too few car refurbishing factories. This won't be true in 15 years. 

This also highlights how different a business SDCs are depending on how vertically integrated you are. Waymo doesn't care about how profitable their factories are, but GM/Cruise will need to for a long time. Exactly.  With robot taxi everything changes with the development of a car.

Today the company that sells the car loses money on every sale.

They make it through maintenance.   So car makers were never going to spend a lot of money improving maintenance.

It is the same with durability.

The look of cars change because that is marketing.   That does not help durability or maintenance. They will definitely still be planned for obsolescence.

The difference will be When and How. With big differences in HW and SW.

It will be planned around minimizing maintenance costs while planning for the 'next generation'.

How long do you think a current SDC taxi EE Architecture, Compute unit, Sensor Set, SW, will still be a) relevant b) competitive. Upgrades will be required by competition and innovation. So maybe the chassis concept could be designed for longer use with the electronics designed to be replaced more often.

We haven't even touched on Security (and safety implications) of new exploits and trying to patch them. (especially if they are HW specific like Spectre/metldown, ZombieLoad)

Apple barely supports products older than 6 years old.  Who is going to patch and update SDCs longer than that?

If they are robotaxis chance are they will have paid for themselves in 3 years, operate another 3 at a profit and then sent back for retrofit/refurbishment or decommissioning.

The reality of maintaining the SW in an SDC older than 5 years becomes very expensive.

There will be very little incentive to make most of the vehicle last the current 15 year time frame.  Modularity will likely become popular. 

I think variations on the VW MEB concept will become much more popular. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group_MEB_platform Curse you, Alfred P. Sloane and your planned obsolescence! Eventually planned obsolescence will become obsolete but not for a decades.  I have no data, but today I wouldn't be surprised to find out that a Waymo or Cruise car lasts 6 months without being completely upgraded with better sensors or compute stacks.  We haven't even begun to think about what a real SDC looks like once the steering wheel is gone.  To some degree the obsolescence is dictated by price points.  It costs a lot more money to build a car that runs longer.  If you are going to replace the car in 5 years because the physical shape of it will change there isn't much reason to build it to go 1m miles today.  

I think 2030 is the earliest we will start seeing the designs settle out and we will see cars built to go 1m miles with basically no maintenance other than tire replacements. I think the cars will be modular allowing pieces to quickly be replaced and serviced.  Parts of the cars will be very easy to replace with upgrades.  If there is some damage on a component the ideal with be to pop it off like a lego brick, pop on a new one, and reduce the amount of labor is spent keeping the car up and running.  I am really interested in seeing how they figure out how to automatically clean the cars to where they feel and smell new.    


Figure these cars will drive 8x-10x as much as the regular car so they could do 500,000 miles in 3-5 years.   Because so much of the technology is constantly improving much of the car could go obsolete within 4 years so there will be a need to replace them.   But this short lifespan is why a SDC car is impractical for an individual to own.  After 4 years its obsolete and only drove you 40,000 miles.  Car companies will be competing against each other though and just because they have a fleet car that lasts 20 years doesn't mean people will want to pay to use it in 20 years.    


Look at the other obsolesce.  Gasoline.  This is the big one that there is going to be a push to make obsolete.    


The government has put fuel economy regulations are car companies but if car companies are operating their own fleets they have a massive economic incentive to be as fuel efficient as possible.  Car companies, car dealerships currently do not pay for the fuel source for cars.  The owners do.  However fleet owners have a big incentive to save as much money possible for their fuel source fuel source.  That is why these cars are going to almost exclusively be EVs.  Likewise these fleet companies are going to want to get the absolute cheapest electricity they can get their hands on.  Which is going to be solar and wind (which are still dropping in price 7%-10% annually).  A fleet can have their own large solar arrays charge the cars to where their financed energy cost will be sub 1 cent per mile.  It will be impossible for gas cars to compete with this on any level.  This is a 50MPG car at 40 cents per gallon gasoline.  Not going to happen.   


  


These large wind turbines you see around America,  they are 1.5-4 MW units.  A 1.5MW unit gives you 1200 KWH per hour of wind.  Round it to 5000 miles of driving per hour of wind.  They typically deploy them in places that get 8 hours of wind per day (or 3000 hours of wind annually) so a single turbine annually could supply 15 million miles of driving per year, at 10 cents per mile cost to the customer the turbine will pay for itself within 18 months.   And of the turbines that is a small one, the big ones are three times that size.    


 Likewise a four acre garage with a 176,000 square foot solar roof will generate 2600 KW of power when the sun is shining or 13,000 miles of driving per hour of sunshine.  In areas with lots of sunshine (where the majority of Americans live)  a garage can generate over 130,000 miles of driving per day at a price far cheaper than grid energy and an order of magnitude cheaper than a gas or diesel engine.  Even with efficiency losses bringing it down to 100,000 miles per day the alternative energies are going to have an enormous economic advantage.","Will planned obsolescence become obsolete in the era of robotaxis?

/r/humandrivencars Isn’t autopilot a requirement to enter The Boring Company’s tunnels? Would that count as a road that has human drivers banned? In some of the comments regarding Tesla's Autonomy Day, someone who test drove mentioned that the car chimed before making a left turn from a stop sign. It was the car's way of telling the driver that it thought the intersection was clear, giving the driver time to intervene if the intersection wasn't. I thought this was a great idea!

&#x200B;

Also, some self-driving cars have displays on the outside, so they can indicate to pedestrians what they are doing. Something as simple as, ""I'm braking,"" or ""I'll wait for you"" would go a long way to easing some of the pedestrian concerns. I think you mean horseless carriages. They weren't self driving. In fact, it was quite the opposite, since horses would sometimes go home on their own. The best example of the ""red flag"" principle right now are the NHTSA/SAE ""levels"" which imagine that it's important to define a self-driving car by what role a human driver has in operating it.       That will be the least important thing before too long, and we'll hopefully stop calling them ""driverless"" cars like we stopped saying horseless carriage, as though the most important thing was the role of the horse. Initially, I can only see some highways, bypasses, or even just a separated lane on certain roads becoming SDC-only to the benefit of safety and efficiency. We might also see neighborhoods with specific ordinances or tax breaks encouraging homeowners to own and use SDCs. 

I honestly can't see human driven cars going away completely for a very long time. Culture will preserve them for as long as they can be maintained or restored.

Also, great portions of rural and even urban areas aren't marked or well-maintained enough to accommodate the theoretical SDCs without controls. Owners of human driven vehicles will definitely push back against any new laws or government funded infrastructure that does not apply to them. You know, NIMBYisms, and such. This. I've been saying this for quite some time. Honestly? That the car manufacturer is going to be responsible for accidents.

Car manufacturers are going to lobby so unbelievably hard to get that removed. Otherwise they can't sell cars in the same quantities as they did before. That leaves leasing (which is expensive) and taxi services. Regulations regarding when a vehicle is road-worthy: front white lights, yellow trun-indicators/warnings, rear red lights, horn, minimum side mirrors and rear-view mirror, seatbelts and airbags, etc. Plus clear regulations (that aren't really followed) regarding driving in public roads.

If you go to any sort of industrial setting vehicles are also fitted yellow strobes on top, have (mostly) designated lanes/spaces, must be driven by a higher-certified driver for the specific vehicle involved and vehicles with lesser visibility require a spotter. (Plus radio comms and supervisors)

There is also a focus on making streets/infrastructure safe and predictable. All this things combined still make transit related incidents the leading cause of death of youth:

> Close to 3,000 teenagers are killed each year in car crashes nationwide, making traffic collisions the leading cause of accidental death among teens ages 13 to 19, according data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) ~ https://www.swoperodante.com/car-accidents-still-leading-cause-death-among-teens/

""Red Flag Laws"" might seem ridiculous from our perspective but the goal of making operating heavy machinery (more than 1 ton) at high rates of speed (>30 kph) trough dense urban areas as safe as possible must remain at the heart of when and how we allow vehicles to operate in our communities.","In the 1800, ""Red Flag Laws"" set rules for self-driving carriages For example, in the UK, there [was a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_traffic_laws) that required self-propelled vehicles to have a footman carrying a lantern or red flag (hence the name) walking in front of the vehicle as a warning to riders on horses, pedestrians, and such.

I'm curious if anyone knows how self-driving cars can safely get around this problem.",SelfDrivingCars,"How will self-driving cars treat ""waving on?""",0," There are traffic rules that decide who goes first out of up to 3 cars at a 4-way stop. With all 4 cars arriving simultaneously, someone just needs to go and then the regular rules apply. 

In a similar vein, my concern is when you come across emergency road work that reduces a road to one lane with a flagman posted at each end of the restricted area. They talk to each other on walkie talkies and coordinate which one is showing STOP to traffic approaching and which one is showing SLOW. They spin their flagpoles simultaneously and that's how the driver knows when it is safe to proceed. 

There is an evil intersection near me that only has stops for 3 directions. The fourth direction has traffic coming off of a sharp downhill right hander and they execute a 90 degree left turn in the middle of the intersection! Traffic can build up at the 3 sides that all have to wait to ensure no one is flying down the hill since they will go flying through the intersection. Two cars will often go at the same time after waiting for a minute or two, only to stop in the intersection to avoid a collision yet block the road for the traffic flying around the downhill curve expecting to have a clear intersection waiting for them. I refuse to enter that intersection via any of the directions that must stop. 

Part of the price of living in some of the earliest populated regions in the nation. They simply had no idea how to plan and build roads in the 1920s and 30s. I'd say, physically, it would just flash it's lights, which is a pretty standard alternative to waving someone on.

As for the car figuring out it's in this sort of situation, this is obviously a big task for SD car makers.

From what I've read, almost all makers use simulators to train their car's Neural Nets. I don't imagine it would be too difficult to design lots of situations where the car ends up in this situation, and guide it to learn the appropriate response.

The difficulty lies in actually getting the car to learn what the other entity's intentions might be, and either precede with caution or 'wave' the other entity on. Won't they be communicating with each other by link? If I were driving a regular car and a self-driving car got to the stop sign at the exact same time as me, I'd just go. They won't hit you.

If four self-driving cars get to the stoplight as the same time it would be kind of funny to see how they work it out. From videos I've seen from the big players, the cars kind of inch forward at stops until they think it's safe to go.

I doubt that self-driving cars will take cues from the drivers of other cars, except things like turn signals and maybe horn honks. They will definitely need to obey the hand signals from police officers or construction workers though, but those people aren't in cars.

There are also times where people tried to wave me through, like to tell me to take a left turn in front of them, when I simply refused. One time I was on my motorcycle and wanted to turn left across two lanes. A car in the lane nearest me stopped and waved me to go through. I shook my head no. They honked at me. I flipped them off and they went on, looking all pissed off. The problem was that their car was blocking my view of the other lane and I didn't trust that they were really looking out for me. In fact, a couple of cars went by as they were waving me through. Fucking idiot thought they were being nice but would have gotten me killed. The same way humans do: poorly.","How will self-driving cars treat ""waving on?""

Lidar might present the data in a way that's easier to process, but if processing power is sufficient, the information you can get with eight cameras and radar is better than what humans have to work with. After reading most of thos thread, it seems to me a big argument has been how effective lidar is. I dont think that's the issue. True, its an effective method. Its also cumbersome and expensive, two things that will NEVER work in a consumer level vehicle. Its not a debate of effective systems, its a debate of consumer viability. Musk definitely has a point with that. [removed]",Critics call Tesla’s Elon Musk ‘irresponsible’ for casting doubt on need for lidar sensors in self-driving cars

I looked through the same list you did.  I ended up buying an all-wheel drive Hyundai Kona.  It is not on the list but all 2019 models have Smartsense (their name for lane keeping) so it would be on the list of ""in progress cars"".

So apparently it will keep people safe by temporarily not being a car. As far as evacuation goes, it would be a massive improvement That's interesting to think about.  I had never though about how natural disasters would effect self driving cars before. Well the first thing is you need a generalized algorithm that calculates from the environment the relative safety of different paths, and then chooses the estimated safest path from the finite paths considered.

&#x200B;

That is, you don't want to have ""special handling"" for a blue moon case, you want the blue moon case to be handled by the general algorithm.  

&#x200B;

So if the road starts shaking or there are flying debris from extreme wind, the car should still dodge the obstacles.  It should view deeply flooded streets as impassible and handle them the same way it handles dead ends.  (u-turn and drive away)

&#x200B;

I suppose there are some interesting edge cases where this general algorithm wouldn't work - take a tornado.  The correct answer for a tornado, if it's approaching, and you are an autonomous car able to reach speeds of 120+ mph with robotic reflexes, is to outrun the tornado and stop under the next hard cover.  (highway bridge or parking garage) Notice how the current deployment of current or near future autonomous vehicles are all in places with mild weather conditions. 

More realistically, they may be able to plan routes to avoid dangerous zones.

Edit: Mike to mild. Sorry, Mike. Natural selection - people without real cars and driving skills die. I wrote a script for postmodern zombie apocalypse where one of the scenes had to do with autonomous vehicles having an evacuation mode activated. One of the features of this mode was to automatically sense occupancy and stop and pick up passengers from other stranded autonomous vehicles.

I'm not trying to be a dick, but spending hundreds of dollars on a PC with a GPU will save the thousands of hours necessary figuring out how to build a simulator from scratch that will still be awful compared to standard tools.  Of course, if you actually do that, you'll know MUCH more than when you started.  But that's realistically a multi-year project, even if you're already a talented engineer.

Always remember, practice safe driving. I didn't watch the whole video, but I watched about 10 turns. I hope I'm wrong, but it really looks like they are turning the wheel to the left while they are still waiting for the traffic to pass. 

That's a really bad idea. If they get rear ended, that's going to send then directly into oncoming traffic. I don't know if they have it programmed in there to avoid things better after a rear end, but I doubt it's something that gets tested a whole lot. 

You're supposed to keep the wheel straight until you are ready to move. How many vehicles does Cruise got driving around now? That really looks pretty good.

I do think that those turns are a little easier than the ones I've seen Waymo struggle with in AZ, though. 

But it's hard to know for sure. It knows what an unprotected left turn is?  That already makes it better than most humans. Reading the tweet a few times: are you sure the computer does the left turns? doesn't it say they practice to optimize the algorithm? Can someone please explain what this is, what it means and its relevance? I'm not from the US so I've never even heard the term unprotected left turn before. While it's great that they're getting that much practice, I can't help but feel ""safely executes"" just means there were no accidents, and not that they were completed autonomously.  In which case I wonder what percentage of those are handled without human intervention?

Whatever the case, it doesn't seem Cruise is strictly hampered by a lack of data.  I am excited to see whatever their version of a public launch is by the end of the year.

> Blackmore’s lidars, which Ars Technica said cost $20,000 apiece, use lasers at a 1550 nanometer wavelength, which can operate at higher power levels than shorter-wavelength lidars made by industry leader Velodyne, but without damaging human eyes. The downside is they have been more expensive to develop. Several other lidar startups, including Hesai, Luminar, and Aeye, also operate lasers at a 1550 nanometers. Expect further consolidation, given that more than 100 automotive lidar developers are trying to sell units, or their companies, to a handful of major buyers. My takeaway is that Aurora has the money to start acquiring other startups. This raises the stakes for less well-funded players. The best lidars will win in the end. Aurora might end up buying Luminar if it turns out to be better tech in a few years. I can see Waymo buying off the shelf from vendors once the market matures. Wasn't Aurora's entire pitch to be a software only company, and let other people figure out the hardware? It's a good time to shop for Lidar. A lot of those companies have some of the talent and technology they need to get build a great product, but not all it. 

Aurora expects to be working at a pilot scale for a long time, and they don't need to fret too hard about the unit cost of their lidar over the near term. 

There are so many approaches to lidar, and so many different companies, it's head spinning to try and sort shit from shinola. But the best Lidar may not an off the shelf unit + software \ from this company or that one, but may instead be the Lidar whose inventors are most tightly integrated into the long term development of ""the driver"". Of course Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and 'only necessary for redundancy' Mobileye already have in-house Lidar. I have written a commentary.

It'll be the new school bus. I picture a system with kid accounts where the parents can keep track of where the kids are going and maybe pull up a video conference with the car so they can chat with them en route. Statistically they are going to be safer than most parent's driving them.  (once the sensors and software stack is working about as well as the theory says it can do)

&#x200B;

And the various cameras inside and out and the GPS tracking of the vehicle means nobody is going to kidnap or abuse your kid.  They will be safer than most other places they could be. This article didn't talk about age very much other than to mention that Uber/Lyft don't allow anyone under 18 to ride by themselves.  The NTSB recommends children under 12 not ride alone while Waymo doesn't allow anyone under 16.  12 makes a lot of sense today as this is when most start getting their own cell phones which would be essential when traveling alone.  I personally think 10 is the eventual correct age but I could be convinced of 8.  For everything below I'll assume a 10 year old child.

>  Suppose the driverless car gets into a pickle of some kind, such as a human-driven car happens to rear-end the self-driving car.  You’ve now got your child mired into a mess, and you aren’t there to  help. Imagine the potentially traumatic impact on the child, having to  deal with the situation on their own. 

Assuming the child isn't hurt, what mess is there to deal with?  The kid just calls another car and leaves as soon as it arrives.

> Another possibility is that the self-driving car encounters a situation that involves the AI deciding to bring the driverless car to a halt, parking at the side of the road, doing so because of some internal system fault or maybe as a result of the roadway conditions seeming to be outside the realm of what the autonomous car can handle. You’ve now stranded your child in a car, maybe in the middle of nowhere, or maybe in the middle of the worst part of town.

How are they stranded in the age of AVs?  Just call another car while hanging out in the air conditioned comfort of the stuck one.  These aren't gas cars and unless there is a batter problem they are more software stuck than hardware related.

> Let’s also consider the aspect of whether a child inside a driverless car is going to be allowed to get out, on their own, if they wish to do so. Do you want your kindergartener child to be able to tell the autonomous car that it should come to a stop at the ice cream shop at the corner, and the child opens the car door and gets out, wanting to quickly get a fun snack? I doubt you’d want your child to be able to readily exit from the driverless car.

You would know if they did it.  I would assume you get notified of drop off and pickups for all the kids in your family.  If you need to physically restrain your kid from not doing something they aren't supposed to do you need to work on that with the kid.  You can't helicopter parent them forever.  Will it happen?  Sure, especially as they get older but you deal with it just like anything else.

> You might say that the driverless car should keep the child locked inside the car, no matter what the child says or does.

No, huge saftey issues and the other is just snacking when they shouldn't.  There is no real danger in them making stops they shouldn't, only imagined danger.

> Some autonomous cars might be outfitted with internal LED displays that indicate the status of the driverless car, being able to let a passenger know when the system or the car might be amiss and aiming to soon halt, but for children such displays or audio warnings could be confusing or scary, and of not much help.

Does the author have kids?  I spent years making up excuses why we couldn't go on the big top 10 scariest coaster in the world.  Finally I ran out of excuses around the time they were 10 and let them go on it without me.  No way I'm doing it.  Sure, some kids have special needs, but the vast majority don't have enough fear.

> It is also likely that automakers will include an OnStar-like capability of being able to have a remote agent that can talk with the passengers of the driverless car, which might sooth the nerves of a child when a self-driving car is having difficulties, though the remote agent isn't actually there in the automobile with the child and unable to truly do much other than try to calm an otherwise possibly panic stricken youngster.

They can also call their parents.  Kids are pretty resourceful and more than capable of taking care of anything that can happen outside of a major crash.

> I’ve predicted that there might be a new kind of role that emerges, a kind of autonomous car chaperone or nanny, a trusted adult that goes along for the ride to help support solo-riding children.

There is no purpose for this.  Imagine all your driving your entire life and when did you need help?  All mine are car breakdowns which isn't a thing with AVs since you just call another AV.  I was in a minor crash one time but I would have just called another AV. Yes whenever There have been conversations about this here in the past.

My conclusion, which was not really mentioned in the article, is that the age at which parents are comfortable letting their kids ride solo in robotaxis in the future will be similar to the age at which parents are comfortable leaving their kids home alone today.

Latchkey kids were a thing in the past, and some young elementary school kids have cell phones today and stay home alone.

Other parents may choose not to let their kid stay home alone until they are much older.

AFAIK there are only 3 states that have laws about minimum ages to leave kids at home alone (Illinois 14 yrs, Oregon 10 yrs, Maryland 8 yrs). 

That’s a huge range, and the states can’t even agree on it! Obviously people are all over the spectrum, and I expect it to be similar for robotaxis. Don't have kids, but those parents are being over protective.  A stranger is unlikely to harm their child.  There is no reason to not put a kid in an Uber.  Self driving even more so.  Kids will be sent by themselves all the time when it becomes a thing.  It'll actually become a question as to how long you can leave small children in a self driving car.  Like, a baby driven 3 miles, no prob.  A baby driven 1,000 miles across country, is that abuse? Ever. As in every chance I can get. Waymo has partnered with Lyft in my area and I can't wait for my family to take a ride! Not now, but not never. I don't have any kids. So, sure. Is this a question about perceived safety of autonomous vehicles or of leaving a child alone? In general letting your kids [XYZ] alone is a bad idea. Better driver than the typical baby sitter Overprotective parents are the real monsters. Like anything else this will phase in.  Initial SDCs will require someone over 18, which will quickly drop to like 10 or 13 after the tech proves itself.  Once SDCs are more common than not on the roads this will drop to 5 or 6.  Eventually down to 3 or 4 as the absolute min.   Need to be well potty trained before putting them in a car alone.  

Have to deal with the 1 off blow tire or whatever scenario.  This probably just involves a 2nd SDC pulling up right next to it and the rider hopping inbetween them.  Or maybe they have SDC tow trucks that just come and pick the thing up and keep going.  It the SDC is like a 1 person pod type car that would be pretty easy. Once there really is such a thing. I expect it will have proliferated in about 10 years but I expect a learning curve. My kids will all be using self driving cars by that time, I’m sure. Eh.. Back in the day sending kids via USPS was popular.

But in personal experience I took trains and airplanes by myself as a child.

And use of public transit by children is pretty common when I was a kid in San Francisco. This is actually the only way I ever want my child transported in an automobile.  

We had a 17-year-old girl run a red light and smash into our SUV a couple weeks ago.  Thankfully - no injuries.  The girl was hurrying to her SAT exam and mistakenly thought a police officer waved her through TWO intersections.  

I can't say for sure she was texting, but let's say that the probability is far from zero. Probably not within the next 5, 10 years (more to do with legislation then anything else), but in 20 years? I could see it There will probably be a minimum age for kids to ride alone (say 13+), and a variety of parental controls to limit their rides. 

For example, no child may ride without their parents having given permission.

For children 13-15, maybe the ride must be initiated by the parents themselves (however that works). Or maybe kids may initiate the ride themselves, but only to specific locations as determined by their parents. (IOW, the 13 year old can take the car whenever she wants, but only to go to school, go to grandmas, or to go home). 

16+, maybe the kid can initiate the ride himself, but the car will send a text to the parent stating that the kid is using the car and what the destination is. My second chance to use a robo taxi will be to send the kids to Grandma's while the wife and I go at it like monkeys in the comfort of our own house, after realizing that robo taxi sex is about as much fun as shower sex. Yes. I can imagine the the AI controlling billionaires autonomous cars that are driving their children would, in an accident situation, choose not to hit the hard brick wall but go for that nice squishy crowd of people that would slow the car down safely.

This is the future we are headed to without regulation.

Edit: spelling Where the heck would they be going that I would send them alone? It's a nonsense argument. I wouldn't let my kids take an Uber or ride on public transit alone. I wouldn't view a self driving car as anything different. Is this a thing that I'm not in the loop on? It has nothing to do with the cars and everything to do with not doing the ""unusual"" thing.

Even if self-driving cars are statistically safer, if it's not the ""normal"" thing to do and you choose to do it and something does happen, you'll feel much more responsible and other people (family, friends) will be harsher towards you.

It's not about actual safety, it's the child version of ""nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"". Go with the crowd and nobody will blame you personally if something goes wrong. Even if the crowd is statistically wrong. I hostel in Japan I met a 12yr old travelling on his own, over 4hrs by train from his parents. He was doing research on castles so he could appear on a TV program.

Western parents have a very strange idea around a lot of child rearing. I haven't gotten a chick pregnant yet but if I choose to do so I imagine the kid will never ride in a car with a human driver. There will be a day that you do not let your kids play with a kid because the parents chose to still drive their car.   Just not safe.

The question is when will that day be?   5 years?  10 years?   50 years?  100 years?

It will happen.  Just nobody knows when",Letting Your Kids Ride Alone In An Autonomous Self-Driving Car: Ever Or Never?

Bus drivers are not too hard to train or pay, yet if a bus of 60 people flips and they all die it would literally end a self-driving-bus company. Regardless of what was at fault. It would make international news. Whereas if a truck dumps $300,000 of merchandise and explodes it's just an interesting tech news item at this point.

It's very sad when a self driving car kills its passenger(s). However I'm happy we've gotten over those first hurdles because now when it happens again it won't be such a big deal. It doesn't make daily (or hourly) news when the 40,000 people a year die (in the US) from human drivers. A self-driving-bus flipping though is not a milestone we've approached yet. Driver salary is a much lower percentage of costs for buses, due to many more passengers per vehicle.

Also, buses are already quite safe I think. Self-driving vehicles will replace busses inside cities. Inter-city transport isn’t a large enough market. Greyhound, like Amtrak, is subsidized because there’s not much money to be made. Unless new busses cost less than maintenance on old busses, sales will be few and far between. Ah i think that is “we need faster horses” thinking!

I believe that buses wont have much of a purpose after self driving cars, as individual transportation will become cheaper then buses are now and will be more efficient. Environmentally, electric cars should hopefully take care of that. Money. I don't have hard numbers, but ride-sharing/freight blow buses out of the water for total market size. Tech bros dont ride the bus.

When he's saying the car should be in the other lane already, the car isn't in Navigate on Autopilot mode yet, so it won't make/suggest any lane changes on it's own. You can tell because the lane lines are blue on either side of the car in the display, instead of a solid blue line in front of the car. 

&#x200B;

The problem I think is he's expecting NOA to work on streets where NOA isn't supported, only regular autopilot. NOA is really only active on highways/expressways. Also, it's really not that hard to keep a continuous small bit of weight on the wheel to prevent the input nag. 

&#x200B;

I believe the cause of the last error is because he accidentally deactivated autopilot during a lane change, and the right turn signal remained on throughout his cloverleaf interchange and during the merge onto the next highway. Autopilot is not going to try to merge left when you have the right turn signal on…

&#x200B;

This review betrays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of how the autopilot system works. It is actually important to understand how people who don't understand the product at all use it.

If they don't offer that the next time I'm ready to buy a car, I'll have to go Tesla.  Their current roadmap doesn't look promising. I mean honestly, autonomous tech is hard, and I think realistically few automakers are likely to gain much by going hard (on shipping cars) like Tesla is. It should be clear that (eventually) other companies will also have self-driving solutions, even if they’re not the first. 

>Daimler, Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo Cars, meanwhile, have forged partnerships with Uber Technologies Inc., while Jaguar Land Rover is teaming up on self-driving electric cars with Alphabet Inc.’s autonomous-vehicle unit Waymo.

Is pretty misleading. Jaguar agreed to sell cars to waymo. That’s not anything incredibly groundbreaking. Same with Volvo and Uber iirc. 

I do think he is totally screwing up the transition to electric vehicles though. Tesla has shown there is a ton of demand for fast electric cars.

The i3 is a joke by comparison. Iirc the Model 3 alone outsold bmw 2/3/5/7 series sedans in 2018 and most of that they were supply limited. 

I think they could have been using their federal rebates to generate a hell of a lot more profit offering a 75k electric m3, after rebate it would be 65k, same as the gas m3, but with better performance. What’s happening to the CEO is the same thing that will happen to their cars. There will be no resell value if cars are not electric and self driving.  In 10 years time it won’t make sense to put money into costly gas and maintenance.  Such a tragedy when they had clearly the right intentions with the i3. Titanic shift... What a unfortunate choice of words... Ze Germans are struggling. They were/are masters of complex system integration and feature development. But this shift is fundamentally different to their usual paths of vehicle development. 

Look at the Etron and MQB (or whatever the electric Mercedes GLE is being called). Both of them are super polished inside, and feel just like their other cars. But their drivetrains are lacking and range is limited. They are struggling with balancing development timelines, features, and the basics. 

Eventually one of the three will figure it out, it’s just not happening as fast as we would like. There is a classic saying about everyone thinking the same is no one thinking at all. I highly suspect there is hardly a thought out of place at BMW. They have perfected the engine and engine related drivetrain they have a road map that will only add to that perfection. This is the opinion of 100% of the senior engineers. So any upstart juniors who want to prove them wrong are just that wrong wrong wrong. Why bother letting the waste any resources just to discover how very wrong they are?

I suspect a few marketing people have forced the few electric things into existence, but would also be willing to bet the senior engineers tell anyone working on them that it is career death.

I have worked with engineers and man o man, there are very few who will change their minds after about age 28. I highly suspect the few who are flexible in their thinking don't find a place at BMW, Ford, etc.

A perfect example of this is the computers you find in the dash of almost any car made. It is 5-10 years out of date the day it shows up in a new car. The pixel density is that of a laptop from 10 years ago. I had a better camera in my last flip phone than any backup camera I have seen. Interfaces were clearly designed before these guys ever saw an iPhone or iPad. Things like bluetooth syncing is sub par. Fundamental features are just wrong; for instance, I have not seen a navigation screen that touches a tom tom from 2010 let alone google/apple maps. BMW take such pride in getting the sound of the ""key in the car"" chime just right, but completely blow something like traction control buttons/controls. Was exploring a BMW i3 and an X6, customer service in Bay Area is shit, no matter you come with 70k to spend they will treat you like shit and act pretentious... and make you wait for an hour even with appointment, not even had the car I wanted to test drive. Show up at Tesla and service was amazing end up getting my X and I love it The problem is that once a car is autonomous, several Marques turn into tits on a bull. 

Why would I want an autonomous Ferrari?  How fun is that?

Why do they want AV cars to have high beam lights?  What good would it do the AV since it doesn't need to see.  The regular headlights make the AV visible to others and having high beams does not help.

> ...and should design the vehicle to require passengers to wear safety belts.

Normal cars aren't designed to do this, why AVs?

My drive 25 miles out of 30 miles daily communte is on Autopilot. 5 Miles requires me to drive, ughh.

I however, agree with the article, especially this.

*Despite Tesla’s promises that it will have full self-driving technology by the end of next year, our experience with Navigate on Autopilot suggests it will take longer.* >  The feature cut off cars without leaving enough space ... As a result, the driver often had to prevent the system from making poor decisions. 

I love navigate on autopilot but this is a mostly true statement, at least here in Atlanta.  I use it in the mode where I must confirm lane changes and I cancel 50% of them.  I wouldn't have worded it exactly like the article does.  I think it's very human like for Atlanta and will merge into tight spots just like anyone on the road would.  Where it fails is not seeing far enough behind the car and it will try to merge into an empty spot in such a way that it would cut someone off that is traveling 10mph faster than you.

>  “It’s incredibly nearsighted. It doesn’t appear to react to brake lights  or turn signals, it can’t anticipate what other drivers will do 

This is how I would describe it.  Very safe, just a bit rude because it doesn't see more than a few car lengths behind your car.  It basically assumes everyone is going close to your speed.  In a big 8 lane highway this isn't true at all.  Part of the problem I'm seeing could be cause by the lag of me needing to approve all the lane changes but I don't think that is it.

> “The system has trouble responding to vehicles that approach quickly from behind,” Fisher says. “Because of this, the system will often cut off a vehicle that is going a much faster speed since it doesn’t seem to sense the oncoming car until it’s relatively close.”

Exactly my experience.

> It is reluctant to merge in heavy traffic, but when it does, it often immediately applies the brakes to create space behind the follow car—this can be a rude surprise to the vehicle you cut off.”

I've had the opposite experience.  I wonder if they have the follow distance high?  Mine is set to 1 which matches how everyone drives here.  If it was set to the default of 3, I could see this being an issue.  This is a very easy problem to solve given how well the other parts of the merge work.  It mergers great, maybe there is just a problem after merge in how it makes space. [removed] As opposed to what other system by what other car company? [removed] What is the driver intervention time in case the autopilot is not able to navigate. Does it give a heads up 5 seconds before or is it instantaneous (as in take over control now) ? One big problem with the review is they keep talking about the ""current hardware,"" including its compute capacity, and use that to make predictions about FSD.

But they never mention the new FSD computer/HW3 that has been in all new Teslas for over a month and is far more capable than the HW2.5 car they tested and discuss.  That's the ""current hardware."" Try to keep up CR. Elon is communicating internal company goals to the public. Amazing that some people expect all goals to be met on a regular basis. Some things are more difficult than engineers expect so take longer. What is important is Elon has excellent vision of the future based upon physics, engineering, and observations of the world with an engineering perspective. He is not a prophet or fortune teller. Nor does he believe padding time lines for unforeseen challenges. He recognizes progress is slowed by arbitrary schedule padding. I’ve been in plenty of complex project planning sessions and everyone likes to add padding. This greatly increases the timeline and cost of projects. All this padding gets pulled out with review and then gets added in as an additional cycle. If the additional cycle is not necessary, then the project completed sooner. Otherwise everyone on the project is executing slower and still in the end an additional cycle is necessary. 
Conservatives are the most disturbed by such scheduling and there always needs to be assurance that everything will be fine. It is just they are afraid of change which leads to uncertainty. They naturally try to slow everything down to reduce their anxiety. This is what we see with the response to Tesla goals, in increases some people’s anxiety due to uncertainty. This just in! Cars need drivers still! Shocking!!! The cars aren't unsafe. At the end of the day they just require someone to drive them. Ignore the marketing hype and drive your two ton death machines... For now. Passing on the right is legal in most states. That one trooper they've asked is likely BSing.

That said, it's a useful article. I'm gonna try not letting Teslas merge in front of me so the the AP doesn't have a chance to brake-check me. I use it every day, especially on long trips. Totally reduces the stress of driving. I won’t drive our nicer car on a long trip anymore because of Tesla’s Autopilot.

Mapping usually prefers daylight scenarios and is of course better with light traffic. After the mapping is done it's still tested in auto with a safety driver to check for issues detecting signals, signs, lanes etc. It's risky to send the cars out not knowing how they'd respond (or not) to speed bumps, curbs, traffic lights. Most of the work is after they collect the data: the team of people that sifts through it to create the map. A vehicle that relies on HD maps will be less reliable in situations where it does not have access to HD maps. I don’t think they’d be willing to risk an accident for the marginal decrease in labor costs. There might be fewer targets to hit at night but it can still happen. Not with Waymo's map-based approach.   It's more work to give the car the ability to drive the whole city without a map on a regular basis than it is to pay mappers to drive it. I wouldn’t say it’s impossible. But why?

Even after it has been mapped there will still be plenty of human verification and validation.  And they will want to drive the roads for maybe a million or more miles with safety drivers.  Before they start driverless cars testing/deployment...

So why not just have a human in the car when mapping? Could be the same person hired to do safety driving. It's not cost effective, and the risk is too high. Mapping takes a couple of cars to drive up and down all the streets,. The marginal cost of mapping is low. 

They might have autonomous re-mapping cars. If a car on the road notices a potential mapping anomaly. Like a speed bump that wasn't there before. It'll trigger an alert. They could decide to send an autonomous mapping car, since the area is already mapped and they are expecting small enough differences that they don't stop autonomous service to the area. 

Eventually, I'd expect the of use arial drones for mapping and re-mapping. Which could easily  be completely autonomous. Absolutely. Not right now though but eventually. I can see them having special vehicles whose sole job is to do the mapping.","Could Waymo map a previously unmapped city with robocars alone?

They'll figure out how autonomous drivers act, and game the system - cutting them off, swerving in and out of traffic knowing that the autonomous cars will have to stop.

Any article that starts out with such a blatant falsehood is unworthy of reading.

No one is even predicting when level 5 will be achieved and it's an all but meaningless goal. It seems likely that the same thing that happened for human drivers (make the roads and system easier for them) will happen for robot drivers. Humans evolved on the savanna; what is even a road except a piece of land designed around the limitations of cars and drivers?

Drop a computer engineer on the straight-ish, well-behaved streets of Mountain View or Phoenix and it is not surprising that the idea of self driving cars pops up. But, you can take a planeload of human drivers from Mountain View and drop them into a developing nation city (Addis Ababa) with donkeys and pedestrians and 4 cars wide in every two lanes and massive unmarked potholes, at night, in the rain, and they will be fine. Same with Northern Sweden country roads in a snowstorm, or Sicily and it's intensely Italian drivers, They will be stressed but fine. Hertz and Avis know this. From a computer science perspective they are utterly different problems, hence the 8.8 billion miles of Toyota testing mentioned in the article. 

The clean, well marked, well lit roads of Mountain View and Phoenix didn't magically spring up, they are designed that way to address the limitations of human drivers and cars. There is no ""Level 5"" car that can go anywhere a human can walk. Roads are a compromise, the roads will be made a robot-oriented  compromise as this stuff evolves. Waymo has never been building an ""L5"" vehicle.  Legacy auto makers want to believe in L5 because it fits their business model of selling cars.  The reality is that it's not going to happen, and people aren't going to want to buy cars that are geofenced, so car ownership will be gradually replaced by TaaS provided by L4 vehicles.

They cannot just be safer. They have to be killing us less often under familiar circumstances.

If self-driving cars are factually safer, but kill some few people under weird circumstances that a semi-attentive human could easily avoid, we're not going to get in them. Imagine the Tesla stories where the car decapitates the occupants by attempting to drive under a semi-trailer crossing the road. Nope. The cars have to be *better than humans* under all circumstances. Wait slow down I don't follow As soon as self driving is safer than humans, it'll save lives? 

This sentence is a tautology because it's a tautology. The hard part is proving with statistical certainty that a system is safer than humans. No one has done so yet (certainly not Teslas window dressing AP numbers). I think the problem is not that self-driving cars are ""just slightly safer"" than cars driven by humans.

It's that self-driving cars are still failing in some driving situations where human drivers wouldn't.

Like how a proper self driving car will probably never rear-end someone (something humans are prone to) but at the same time fails to detect crossing semis (something a human will never ever miss). Societies will never accept the bar of “safer than humans”. A machine that kills someone will require a very, very low failure rate to be accepted. Can you imagine if guns randomly killed people with no human interactions? It’s not just about safety it’s about confidence and usability.  If a SDC gets stuck in the left turn lane or misses a turn for no apparent reason it is too early to be deployed.

No one wants to be driven by a car which is technically safer but is overly reliant on a remote operator providing corrections.

Additionally if your vehicle has to stop and wait out rain or snow, people will unfortunately lose patience. With set driving and no accidents. How will this affect insurance? Do we need insurance going forward? Interested bcuz I'm paying through the roof. I live in Canada. Even having an EV car, it's way too much here. It's hard to overstate how many cognitive biases we have around personal safety. 

Expecting logical behaviour in this domain is asking way, way too much. 

It's program your neural nets to be basically error-free or get nowhere. Waymo knows this. Yes, but. But 90% of human drivers believe they are above average drivers. And 90% of human drivers will believe they are safer than autonomous vehicles at whatever level of safety those vehicles achieve. AVs not only have to BE safer, they have to be PERCEIVED as safer by most of the driving public. This is a high bar to jump over. To all those wondering why a tautology is relevant, I think the point is that the cars need to have a certain level of safety or (a different thing) **perceived** safety to even be allowed on the road. While the cars may be safer than humans, it will take a while to convince regulators to allow them. That seems to be where the question is coming from: how good do the cars have to be, to convince people? People being regulators and citizens who can influence regulators.

I think that the self driving cars will need to be at least a couple orders of magnitude safer than humans to be allowed on the roads completely unsupervised. Here's why.

US auto accident fatalities are at around 37,000 per year.

Tesla market share is around 2%. Taking Tesla as an example here. Yes, there are other companies.

If Teslas were represented proportionally in the number of fatalities, there would have been 740 Tesla related fatalities in the last year. Instead, we've heard about what, maybe 3.

It's a truism that the media frantically reports on every fatal Tesla crash. So it's likely that the 3 crashes (if that; I can only think of two; I'm being generous) we've heard about are all that happened in roughly the last year. Sticking to the US for purposes of discussion.

Unlike Tesla crashes, fatal non-Tesla crashes don't get wide media distribution. Sure, there may be a story in the local paper, but it's not syndicated and hyped up on major media networks.

This is the case today, without full self driving. It's safe to say that when we do have full self driving, the media coverage of any accident will be even more dramatized.

Going by the above numbers, currently the media dramatizes Tesla accidents approximately 200-fold. In other words, the same amount of ink is spilled for 1 Tesla accident as is spilled for around 200 non-Tesla accidents.

So, I would venture that to overcome this media effect around novel technologies, self-driving cars will need to be at least 200 times better than human drivers to even reach parity in public perception. To be *seen* as better (which is different from actually being better, a much lower bar), they will have to start with 200x better as a baseline, and improve on that.","Self-driving cars have to be safer than regular cars.

Somehow, it still failed. Of all the things you would expect Tesla to identify, these few things which resulted in fatal accidents, like a truck side and a highway crash attenuator, should be at the very top of the list. Either they weren’t, or the training done even on this highly important thing was inadequate, and both of these are not good things. I think there is still some information missing.  All 55mph and under roads I have driven on limit the car to 5 mph over the speed limit.   This car was going well over 60.    

Two possibilities.
1) This road didn’t apply and allowed more than 55.  Someone around there needs to check that road with there TM3 and see.

2) The driver had his foot on the accelerator and was pushing the car beyond 60.   The car says on the screen when you do this that it will not slow down or brake.    It is stated because you are overriding AP.

I haven’t seen any clarification on these pieces.   Of course he should always be paying attention anyway. Looks like they still haven't. This is from yesterday ""AP just sent me under a truck"".

Not to have fixed the problem three years later but still keep these cars on the road is criminal negligence. The title makes it seem like it’s 100% Tesla’s fault. Obviously Autopilot was a major factor. 

In both cases, the drivers were using the system in areas with cross traffic. The manual explicitly states that the system should not be used in areas with cross traffic.

In both cases, the driver was not paying attention to the road. The drivers had ample time to react, but didn’t see a semi truck directly in front of their car. 

I understand the argument for geofencing the system where it shouldn’t be used, but at the same time these drivers are misusing the system and then not paying attention despite multiple warnings. There is no way this accident would’ve happened if the driver was even 1/4 paying attention. This isn’t a case of someone zoning out because the system gave them a false sense of security. It’s a person negligently  taking their attention completely off the road for 10 seconds at minimum.

I experienced it myself this morning.

Ya know how when another car turns in front of you when on AP and the car slows waaaaaay too early? I had a school bus cross my intersection (they had a stop sign, I did not) and they were far enough ahead that I wouldn't brake, but I assumed AP would, so I hovered over the accelerator.

Nothing.

The car had no clue that bus was there. If it was a car, it would have slowed big time. I didn't intervene, but the car got closer to that bus than I would have.

Always pay attention on AP. Especially when you're not on the highway.

Edit: sorry I thought I was in a tesla subreddit which is why I said ""ya know"" in the second paragraph lol. >The roof of the Model 3 was sheared off as it hit the truck’s trailer, passing underneath, and then coming to a stop 1,600 feet away.

Trailers should have guard rails! There is that ""hands were not detected on the wheel"" line again.   We see it in most Autopilot accident reports. If you have never driven with Autopilot, you might think it means the driver's hands were not on the wheel.  It does not.  It means the driver was not applying torque to the steering wheel, and that is quite normal for autopilot driving, in fact you have to physically take an effort to apply that torque.   You can drive, hands firmly and well positioned on the road, attentive to the road, and get the warning from Tesla that it has not detected you.   In fact, this is common. Staying alert is basically impossible for a task that requires no interaction 99% of the time.  

This is a well researched problem in the industry with line workers.  

They solve it by rotating them or only automating 50%, thereby forcing to workers to regularly interact and keeping a baseline of alertness.  

I find Tesla's approach flawed because of that, you can't just tell people to pay attention. It sounds like he engaged autopilot, and immediately started not paying attention whatsoever to the road. Fellow Tesla owners, please repeat after me. Autopilot is not autonomous driving. You can't take your eyes or attention off the road. Autopilot is awesome and I love it, but it hasn't reached the level of full autonomy. It's made stupid decisions that have almost wrecked my car, which is why you have to pay attention. > The National Transportation Safety Board says Autopilot was engaged during a fatal Model 3 crash in March. Driver activated Autopilot, took his hands off the wheel, and was dead 10 seconds later after he hit a tractor trailer crossing the highway

Damn! Only 10 seconds later. Lidar definitely would have prevented this.  This type of scenario is exactly why Lidar is required.  Lidar doesn't care about the color of the item and whether it matches the background of the sky, Lidar measures the distance to an object and the size of that object.  A simple front facing Lidar would have prevent this accident, it would also prevent all of the times Teslas crash into fire trucks and stationary objects.  It would also prevent any unnecessary braking due to shadows or overpasses.   


Tesla's Neural net had two years to figure out this scenario and they couldn't do it.  Now a second person has died.  Tell me again how Lidar is a crutch? Either the system is full self driving and flawed therefore Tesla is liable or, it is as advertised, *not a full self driving system* that drivers are *always responsible* for. You cannot sit one ass on two chairs. No one is out here suing people or writing verge reports on cruise control. Either you give Tesla the autonomous credit you don't want to give it *and* you blame them for these crashes *OR* you accept Tesla's system is not a full autonomous system and keep your fucking hands on the wheel no matter what anyone *who doesn't work for the company* tells you. This is not a full self driving debate. If you are so damn terrified just drive the car without it. Or listen closely AND KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE WHEEL. But but..According to Elon, this would never happen again. Its so good now it will stop for a UFO in complete fog situation.

I'm not saying Tesla need an array 360 Lidars, just a basic cheap front-facing one to avoid situations like this. A car can never exceed Level 2 until it can be trusted not to crash into things head on. To me, the truly amazing this is that the Tesla traveled *1,600 feet* before stopping. Even if it had lost no speed in the collision and continued at 68 mph, that's 16 seconds of driving. That's insane. I suspect Autopilot kept running post-crash, which is a huge design flaw for Tesla. The car could have crossed the median into oncoming traffic or driven into someone else's yard. This is completely preventable. Keep your hands on the wheel stay alert.   Especially on roads with cross traffic.   You can get in a crash even if everything is working as it should(not in the case). Some are unavoidable.  

You don’t hear much talk about the different types of deaths from human to FSD.   I assume all deaths will decrease.  Most human deaths are poor decisions, drinking or falling asleep.  Those types will fall drastically with even AP in its current state.   The ones that remain will be camera sensor vision problems.  Like the person on the bike at night or this tractor trailer.   Both of those could and do happen with human drivers but seems different when FSD cars do it.   How much improvement is acceptable? Does anyone know if these vehicles running parallel? Or was it a head on crash? With Subaru EyeSight, Honda Sensing, Nissan ProPilot, and Toyota Safety Sense, etc, it's only Tesla that gets the headlines when there's an accident from some overconfident driver. Tesla: Please pay attention at all times. Also our cars can practically drive themselves and here is a giant tv screen on the dash to fiddle with. I think before driving off in a Tesla you should be required to sign a waiver indicating you're not a dumbass and that you know what use cases autopilot supports. Hopefully it will cut down on these articles. How can people be this dumb?

I want to know how groundtruth is generated for planning and control module? And how are they validated?",SelfDrivingCars,How do we test a module in autonomous vehicle?,3," I lead a team of test engineers building test tools for Autonomy platforms and ADAS ECUs.

The standard “validation” procedure for any distributed AV system is simulation through “software-in-the-loop” and “model-in-the-loop” testing. That’s been covered below. What you need to do this well are high fidelity sensor models, a world view that mimics real life, and computational intense physics engines.

What follows after MIL, SIL, and simulation is often contested between “Detroit” and “Silicon Valley” mentalities. Automotive ECUs have a rigorous test procedure that occurs before the system is mounted in an enclosure or on a vehicle. They emulate the input signals into the ECU and verify the output signals, in hardware, through a process called “Hardware-In-The-Loop.” How to employ this test type for a non-heuristic NN-based ECU is a thing of ongoing research and development currently. This will ultimately be critical to ensure safe and reliable autonomous platforms. Many SF based companies are content with just putting the system on a vehicle after they unit test their software because they have safety drivers just in case.

Aside from that, there’s an entire production test process that’s more on functional test (does it turn on, how much power, etc) that the system undergoes.

To answer your question about planning and control, most AV companies are not employing an “end-to-end” ML approach for control. They use known robotics principles that can be computationally solved through Jacobian matrices and soft-body physics. The ground truth is the physics principles. This is where the entire field of multibody vehicle dynamics comes in. This can be validated by other multibody software like IPG CarMaker, MCS Adams, or others.

As a side note, some companies refer to far more or less than “four modules,” but they all follow the sense, plan, act robotics paradigm. For control testing, standard approaches from the automotive industry can be used.

One would the again simulation approach, but this time with the (nearly) complete vehicle on a testbench. If you look at this photo from an engine test bench, it becomes quite clear what is going on: https://infothek.bmvit.gv.at/assets/uploads/2017/12/AVL-ADAS-Antriebspr%C3%BCfstand-1.png

Here rotation of the tyres can be measured as well as breaking behaviour. Combine this with an induced scenario (object list), and you have (hopefully) an emergency break etc.

The same can be done but also in the field, e.g., on a separate test field. You drive your car around and over your vehicle bus you pretend that your perception stack has recognized some objects. Then your car will stop in real life with a driver in the inside (or not ;) ). simulation scenario testing, test track scenario testing and specific on-road testing.","How do we test a module in autonomous vehicle?

Handling unpredictable, cacophonous traffic with many pedestrians in a poorly marked and poorly maintained city street setting during a nighttime thunderstorm is clearly  more of a challenge than daytime driving in a closed neighborhood with no pedestrian traffic and perfectly maintained roads.

Humans have trouble driving in straight lines in broad daylight. Why are any of these issues unique to self driving cars? Just this morning I was stuck in traffic caused by a three car rear end collision on a straight stretch of dual carriageway highway.

No one knows, how many companies will crack it or what business model will be successful. 

If you are 10 or 15 years ahead of everyone else, a vertically integrated model makes lots of sense. You can't buy the right type of mapping, or fleet management, or operations support. You must build it. 

By vertically integrated I mean you make the driver and operate the service and possibly manufacture the car. Car manufacturing is the only part of the eco-system that is established enough to cut out of a vertical operation.  

If you are a first mover with a vertical operation, you also have some visibility into which part of the stack generates the most attractive profits. You could then de-integrate and invest in the most profitable parts of the business. 

If you have better technology, say level 5. Then I'd do a pure licensing play. Level 5 tech doesn't need deployment support, cause it's level 5. You could decentralize fleet management, people and franchisees buy a car and maintain it, and put it out on exiting Taxi networks. This has the advantage of focus for your company, while placing lots of operations and capital risk outside your company. 

What's likely to happen. (BTW, I've been predicting this for a while.) There is a path dependance issue, and regulatory route to ensuring less competition. So imagine Waymo starts removing safety drivers in 2020, someone else less cautious will try to do the same, it will be a disaster. The best response to that is for the big players, Waymo/Cruise to start lobbying for minimum requirements before pulling drivers. Requirements that will ensure only companies with absurd capital reserves can compete. While the capital requirements to get to level 4 and above were always absurd, there was always a chance with some extreme luck a company could surprise with some kind of great AI tech breakthrough and a very high risk tolerance. However, I think that is unlikely. 

&#x200B;

Given capital requirements involved, i think ultimately the number of players who can actually deliver level 4 and above will be very small. I'd expect all of them to license their tech eventually, as well as operate vertical businesses.  Why build something that'll cost you $10b, when you can buy it for 1bn. Local market conditions will determine how the tech is licensed. The US market will probably have a few fleet networks you can choose from. Like cell phone providers. Other countries markets will look different, I'd imagine you'd want to grow fast enough to ensure fewer companies spend money to develop the tech. That means licensing or partnering in some markets. Some services will be state-run, they will license the tech. 

Aurora's model makes sense if you think that the tech is at least a decade away, and they'll be a more mature ecosystem to support it when they roll-out.  

GM/Cruise has a really good shot as a second mover if they can, being a manufacturer, more quickly diversify their fleets to serve more use cases. But culturally this will be hard for them. The headwinds affecting manufacturers, too much capacity, will hurt them, and big parts of their business will push against canibalization. Gm's biggest problem is it's size. I think a smaller manufacturer with a diverse product line, could do well in partnership because they won't have stranded assets. I can't point you to a summary, but there are at least a few names going down the license route:

Aurora is planning on releasing a ""driver"" which I believe they intend to license to a variety of car manufacturers.

- Check out the sensor package from [Autonomous Stuff](https://autonomoustuff.com/)

- This is good, ""cheap"" GPS/IMU [microstrain](https://www.microstrain.com/inertial/3dm-gx5-45)
- Everyone I know uses Velodyne LiDAR, but Ouster is becoming popular too. There are also lower FOV options from Cepton and Livox.
- Cameras? Pick your favorite GigE camera.
- Delphi makes cheapish RADAR units which communicate over CAN. We use velodyne 16, 64, and 128, novatel gps, continental’s radar, and 6mm & 12mm cameras There is radar as well. No team has a anything more than an expanded beta, right?  So the sensor volumes are small. For cameras it's going to really depend on the software pipeline the group has decided on but there are two manufacturers I'm familiar with:  
  
http://www.alliedvision.com  
https://www.flir.com/iis/machine-vision/ <- Used to be Pointgrey  
  
Also it looks like you're assuming cameras come with a lens which isn't the case for industrial machine vision cameras (usually). For lenses to pair with my cameras I use these guys:  
  
https://schneiderkreuznach.com/en/industrial-optics/products/lenses  
  
Some of the lenses I've bought from there come in a ruggedized version which is nice. Good question.  If they have any sense at all, they should be using [u-blox](https://www.u-blox.com) for GPS.  Everything else, even sensors you associate with high precision, are inferior, especially when moving.  All the other manufactures think they can do high precision but most of them can't even fully disable their internal Kalman filters.

I tried to go through Tesla's part catalog but didn't find it but [this source](https://teslatap.com/undocumented/) says they use a u-blox for s/x and some other blox engine for the 3.  It's pretty common for u-blox to do very custom work.  Hopefully they paired it with a good antenna but I couldn't find any information at all on that.  The antenna is probably even more important than the engine in a car since power consumption isn't an issue. We use Apollo from Baidu and acquired all the hardware sensors from Autonomoustuff. They sell an Apollo kit where it has a full list. Btw, what are you guys trying to do? Answering your questions:

Hello

I have a background in remote sensing and I have been reading a lot about self driving vehicles. I understand on a high level as to how they function. I have read many articles and posts which go over the different sensor suite that these vehicles rely upon. However, what I am interested in now is to figure out what actual product (brands/model/version) options are popular in the industry for each sensor? Sensors namely being: 

* GPS/GNSS, 
* IMU/INS, 
* LiDAR, 
* Wheel Encoders,

I think it would be good to have a resource that identifies the major players - where they're at, what they're working toward, the timeline they've committed to, who they're partnered with, etc.  

Quite honestly, the videos, articles, and criticisms, I would do away with those.  There are so many out there these days, it seems silly to highlight a few of them as somehow ""special"".  I would make an exception for a link to the CA disengagement reports since those are only once per year and our only source of actual data (for whatever it's worth).

Same with Terminology.  There's a lot of confusion today about what is or isn't an SDC, what is FSD, what the levels mean...That dust is just going to have to settle on its own as the industry evolves. 

And as I recently brought up, I would *LOVE* to have a ""common arguments"" area.  There are some (often incorrect) points that are made over and over and over again.  I don't know if it would work to curb the number of times they're brought up, but at least then they can be addressed (at least partially) by simply linking to the sidebar, rather than rehashing the same conversations each time. I think the sidebar suggestions could be very helpful as a kind of a hotkey for often repeated arguments. That said, as long as people are not being abusive or threatening I'm for letting everyone say what they want to say. The remedy to speech you don't agree with is more speech not suppressing speech.

Even though it can be tedious rehashing the same arguments time and time again I still think there's value in doing so.

And they don’t know what’s really going on in the other companies. So *no one on earth* really knows the whole story, just pieces. This sub mainly exists to talk about what is known — released or shared publicly — and argue about the rest.

Most of the companies are either totally silent, or make glossy videos that overstate their capabilities. Sometimes they vacillate between both extremes. Fans and haters get to decide how much credence to give each company, and even each individual press release. 

It’s a race, and everyone has strengths and weaknesses. If you look around a little, you can probably find a team you like, and just as easily find a team you hate.

The consensus seems to be that it’ll all be much clearer in a couple of years. Maybe there will be some obvious winners or losers. Most likely we’ll all still be arguing. I suppose on big issue, currently in review by state and federal agencies, is liability. Until that is delineated, I we'll have the backup driver ready to take control. I have yet to hear a convincing argument that answers the question, ""who's at fault,"" should the driverless car result in a fatality. Like many things in tech, once achieved, it will start to mature and diversify.


Waymo has achieved level4, though in small scale. I’m pretty sure they’re on track to scale it pretty fast. Their new simulation AI from Drago’s MIT talk on YouTube is crazy innovative.

Uber has been doing so much better under the new CEO. They’ve been contributing research & some open source tech. Their hardware, software, infrastructure & tools are impressive. I hear they’re migrating from their bare metal to AWS, after some architecture needs changed while things progressed.

Cruise is hard to read. They seem to make progress, overpromise & change plans a lot.

Aurora is coming up fast. They made strong fund raising & structure decisions which helped with with client/partner portfolio. Then raised more cash to build stuff for clients. I think that they’re now ahead of Argo regarding their future outlook. Probably Cruise as well.

Argo came out of the gate hard & quietly. If they don’t land that Volkswagen money, they could have some interesting challenges ahead with only $1b to get their product shipped.

Zoox is a high risk project. Building a new car at scale for the first time is hard, ask Elon. Building a self driving system is hard. Doing both? Google pivoted away from that model for a reason.

Tesla is determined to do it differently. They’ve had a revolving door of leaders: Sterling Anderson, David Nister and then a few less impressive folks after that. It seems like people abandon ship when they realize the architecture has hamstrung them without lidar & better compute. The new chip strategy is really interesting.

Lyft is late to the game. But as I noted, there are many solved problems. They’ll go zero to state of the art fast but then push up against those last cases like everyone else.

PonyAI is off to an impressive start. Great early team to build from.

Baidu... don’t get in a Baidu car. No self driving car can safely drive you. Watch teslas self driving day live stream.","Where exactly are we at with self-driving cars?

In any event I think the main point of OP was the need for an advanced discussion / just-the-news sub.  Maybe start a new one? Yes I agree this would be a good idea. And I know I’m guilty of fueling these arguments too. I agree i thought about this weeks ago but i said alas nothing will happen. Unfortunately this thread will be down-voted by the very same invaders and the mods stand by and do absolutely nothing.

There should be lists of things at the side bar such as: Failed SDC Predictions (or just Self Driving Car Predictions), which would list all the past/current statements from various companies. \*cough\* Elon Musk \*cough\*

Other links such as 2016/2017/2018 Disengagement Report, List of Sensor Config (Which lists the sensors stack for every company). This would educate people, most of these un-informed people don't even know other companies use cameras.  I have a whole list of things that need to be done to revamp the sub and educate people which would result in actual intellectual discussions but nothing will be done. Look around we still have no banner or background. such a bang up job being done around here. Er, kind of a newbie here...  What's wrong with the assertion that humans don't need lidar to drive?  It seems compelling to me.  But I am genuinely interested to know why that's a flawed position. Yeah, it's clear Elon Musk won the internet with his Autonomy Day presentation. I think ""winning the internet"" was actually its main intention.

Sadly, they didn't demonstrate any new functionality -- their demo from 2016 was about the same in terms of features.

Instead, they seemed to specifically push on all the possible wedge issues between themselves and their competitors. Instead of showing results, Tesla just wanted to make it clear that *they are totally different.* For Tesla fans, this is a huge part of its narrative, and they loved it!

The presentation was also targeted at laypeople, and their lay audience was totally blown away by supposedly ""new technologies"" like neural net accelerators and visual SLAM -- even though both of those technologies have been around a long time. They also silently thumbed their noses at the experts -- they even showed a depth estimation paper from Google Brain as evidence of their own progress!

So, put all that together, and...

The Autonomy Day presentation has motivated literally thousands or millions of amateurs who now come to forums like this one and just repeat his talking points and argue his side on every wedge issue.

So doing nothing is also super risky. Company says its competitor is doing it wrong. Shocker! Yet another article that says Lidar vs No Lidar. > Google’s self-driving car arm  has warned ...

Ho ho ho. Hard to do worse than humans. It's weird how this subreddit is mostly just filled with Elon cultists. I think this is a much more appropriate article for a business piece, as in Musk's plan is very, very, risky for the stock price.

He has this idea that he can make computer vision work absolutely reliably and his plan is to start making cars today that can be leased out so that when the computer vision stuff works they can have a pre-existing base of vehicles for a TaaS fleet.  But every day they go without implementing Lidar is one more day they are going to need to figure out how to do it IF they can't get computer vision working perfectly.  Its one more car they built that isn't going to be capable of operating as a TaaS vehicle for them later.  Its tens of thousands of less miles of data from their vehicles on the road that they can use to train these systems.

It is a huge bet because it is almost certainly going to take years to tell if he was right or wrong, his arguments for why he is right are currently hugely speculative and simply a matter of what his gut tells him, and if he gets it wrong there is very little chance of Tesla being able to turn the ship around and compete with Waymo.  Period.  

I don't think a lot of people in this sector understand that once Waymo launches they are instantly going to become the benchmark for safety.  It is going to be extremely difficult for Uber or Tesla, or anyone else to launch if they cannot show they are at Waymo's level of safety - which is going to be a constantly moving target assisted by millions of miles of driving every day.  A few months of general launch might be all Waymo needs to establish a safety standard that is technologically impossible for anyone else to match before a general launch.

This is a huge, very, very, risky bet by Musk, but it isn't so much a bet with people's lives as it is a bet with the market value of his company.

The bet he makes with people's lives is his super shitty marketing of autopilot's current capabilities. Caveman voice:

Lidar better. Lidar too expensive. Second paragraph says Musk is not adding Lidar to save money. This is a mischaracterization, and therefore, FUD Elon's recent public takedown of Lidar seems risky to me. What if he is wrong?  

He was so confident and sure of himself as he called those using Lidar fools it would be hard to admit defeat without damaging his ego.  This makes me less confident in Elon's approach.

Is his approach better it is he just afraid to admit he was wrong?

He might not be wrong but tying the decision to his ego makes me feel less safe in a Tesla. It's risky but for none of the reasons that they list in the article. I think what Tesla is doing requires three very's, not just two.  That said, it doesn't mean they shouldn't do it. The additional costs that Tesla would be exposed to  in developing the silicon to run the their ADAS software will put them deeper in the red. Moreover, they would also need to add major R&D infrastructure to test all these ideas. How are these people testing their own system? I don't know, but I imagine they must eventually put cars on the road with drivers validating the decisions of the cars.

Tesla is ""testing"" self driving on hundreds of thousands of vehicles doing real world driving and validating AP vs real world driving many times every second. 

The best part Tesla is ""testing"" AP without interfering with the driving activities. AP simply makes predictions in shadow mode and test them against real world driving.

Basically a car that equals a human or better.

But in limited situations, geofenced, weather fenced, supporting database is obviously not a decade away.

How is that Level 3 Audi doing that ""shipped"" in 2017? The list is wrong / outdated. As an example, Tesla’s can identify Traffic lights as of the latest firmware. People in this sub are way to obsessed with who is first. Apple didn't build the first phone, airbus was many decades late in the airplane game and Microsoft didn't make the first operating system by far.

It is fully possible that the best self driving car company won't even be started in the next decade.

I am a lot less concerned about first and a lot more concerned about businessplan, price, reliability and ease of maintenance. That picture is completely wrong... This is more than a year old pic. Tesla now has released all of these and more, so

The interesting part though is that Mobiley have worked on it for ~20 years while Tesla managed to catch up in ~2.5, so it's very weird they are systems with similar capability How are they able to gain access to Tesla’s FSD firmware? It’s not even made public, how would they be able to make the comparison?? If you want to pick a point in time to compare then that is fair.  However guessing at how many years behind they are into the future is not accurate...which this suggests.   If you want to say mobileeye had what Tesla does now 2 years ago then ok.

Everyone seems to forget how neural nets learn and what they need to learn.  They also forget Tesla has the most real world data and is growing in data exponentially.     To say two years is just some number someone wanted to throw out to make mobileeye look farther ahead.

people are already doing a lot to hack engine computers and modify tunes. It's just a matter of time before people start doing the same to autonomous features. Yes the trained models surely could be licensed, however there is tight coupling with the inputs (sensors) and the computational hardware so they are probably better off keeping the hardware/software as a complete package. The task is far too critical to be offloaded to the cloud, any loss of connection could be fatal. There are plenty of people who are working towards this today. Comma.ai has been mentioned in here already, and there is a bunch of money behind [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) (think ROS for cars).

Now whether their efforts will keep pace with commercial self driving in terms of features and safety. After all, people who can develop self driving vehicles are a hot commodity, and all their work is closed source.

It is likely that companies will fork platforms like Autoware, like [apex.ai](https://www.apex.ai/), and license that. It is unlikely that it will become FOSS. Yes. This is my assumption for what Apple is doing with Project Titan, whether or not they also build their own car; as will Google with their new car platform. Actually, the entire SDC will be white labeled too, e.g., imagine Motel 6-branded autonomous pod cars as alternatives to actual freeway-side motels. I personally think that there will be a market for self-driving software, since there is a need for a second/third independently developed stack with strict segregation of training sets.

I don’t think it will necessarily be cheap or used on something like AWS.  It will probably be the kind of software that you negotiate a multi-million dollar deal for X number of seats+ongoing support.  People will probably make small jacked versions though.  100% chance. Eventually sure. There’s open source everything else. IDK if you’d be allowed to use your own hacked SDC build. Someone ask Elon during a earnings call and he’ll say it’s coming next month. No. There will be a handful of players with 90 percent of the market, a winner take most scenario. To make money in the mobility as a service segment you have to be almost perfect. A system that's only slightly better than human drivers wouldn't last a week. Yes, given that every type of software ends up as a service that is very likely. It will be something like downloadable virtual machines/docker so you don’t need an always on internet. Technology aside.  There may be business reasons why companies avoid doing such a thing.  They would have to financially justify cost of custom development rather than outsource it to a service provider.   For road usage they will want to go on someone else's insured platform that has been approved by regulatory agencies.    


At some point we will likely see a Mickey Mouse themed Disney Cruiser that will say ""Powered by Waymo"".   Where the interior is tricked out and customized for Disney's needs.  They operate it as their equipment but the running operation is contracted out to Waymo. Some companies are already going into this business model, with the intent of producing a software product that they would licence to companies who wish to offer a robotaxi service, or to vehicle OEMs. But that's not something *you* could pay a fee to use, and it'll likely never be as simple to buy this software as Photoshop, for a few reasons:

1. The software is tightly coupled to the sensor and compute platform. Photoshop is simple: if you run it on a tiny laptop and it's too slow or runs out of memory, that's your fault. Driving is a hard-real-time problem. If your car runs out of memory or starts dropping frames, it'll probably kill you and others.
1. Closely linked to this is validation. Although it's still not clear what regulations there will be to ensure SDCs are safe, it'll almost likely involve testing the whole system. The combination of software, compute platform, sensors, and vehicle need to be tested together, probably in an expensive process with lots of paperwork. Even if there ends up being completely inadequate safety regulation, no reputable software vendor would sell you safety-critical software that they haven't tested in the intended environment. It's just a recipe for lawsuits.
1. The biggest players - the ones most able to support a retail business - don't want to sell their software at all. They're chasing after a huge market: personal mobility. The vehicle OEMs also don't want you to buy the software, because they don't want to become like PC OEMs, selling only low-margin hardware in a contracting market. Yes, I believe so. If you built a completely new town/city, you could regulate for just one system to be allowed (including banning human drivers) such that it could be the safest system around.


Since that's not going to happen, any system will have to be able to work with humans and other systems on the road. Therefore, no-one will be able to ""shut-out"" any other system.


There might be consumer preferences if one system proves to be superior to the others but that will only go so far.


If an OEM has developed their own system that is the ""best"" then that is a source of competitive advantage that they won't want to share with others. If it's been developed by anyone else, they are motivated to get it into as many different cars as possible so they would want to licence. I think it will be more like the Android operating system, where hardware manufacturers license the software and tweak it for their hardware, rather than end users licensing the software and just installing it on whatever hardware they have.

That said, unlike Android, end users having super user access to the software is just asking for trouble, so I can't see end users having much ability to change things. [Jaguar/Land Rover](https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2019/04/money-earn-you-drive-jaguar-land-rover) has just released a PoC that lets you earn cryptocurrency while you drive. It shares data of important events and gets paid in return.

This data can be fed into data models and bought back to improve your self driving car in due time.

It’s quite an exiting application of cryptocurrency that has real world potential. I work in this space.

You can't possibly get so much data throughput in order to handle a car unless 5G becomes mainstream (even then we'll have limitations). This is since cars generate around 5 terabytes of data per hour given the entire sensor suite. You do the math and the amount of gigs we'll need to process per second or millisecond and having 0 latency will literally be impossible.",Will the software behind self-driving cars become a thing that people could cheaply license or use like say things on AWS? There are so many ideas that could be possible but you see a bunch of companies each pouring tons money into their own self-driving computer vision software. If their products are entirely based on so much self-driving research. Could we expect them to make self-driving API's that you could pay a fee use?

I could see those [half semis](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/semi-truck-driving-on-mountain-450w-1017851425.jpg)  being used more often and the autonomous portion links up 2+ together for the long haul then they get split back up at destination city. Also I would suspect that the actual truck portion would be much different in design, more like what was shown in [that one Wolverine movie](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/g3y5rlcctp5ng63hkxk7.jpg) I have been talking about, and presenting on, this issue for the last 4 yrs in my presentations on autonomous trucks.  With road maintenance being the single highest cost for any transportation agency, invoking huge sums of money, I believe that we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to address the balance of costs of the road with costs of the goods in shops by getting the axle load at the sweet spot. Interesting.  You are correct about the damage to the roads.  There would be huge tax dollars savings if there weren't heavy trucks.  Would be interesting to hear about the financial feasibility when you don't have the cost of the driver per delivery vehicle. In Europe we have double articulated semi's which are being used more and more as they're more efficient for emissions and fuel use. 

For specific deliveries with electric drive lines, it's possible, but there's still going to be long haul trucks that are just transporting their entire contents from A-B. It's more likely we'll see even longer trucks as it's easier to park trucks with multiple articulations with automation. Or just long platoons of semi's. Its not just road damage, but also the convenience and safety of large trucks in cities. In London we have a constant issue with cyclists getting crushed by big trucks. Eventually we will insist on smaller trucks. Several disjoint issues at play here.  
\- efficiency of moving goods.  
\- road damage costs of heavy trucks  
\- interactions between heavy trucks and smaller vehicles, cyclists + pedestrians.

\- competition between freight companies, owner drivers and customers needs.  


Any good freight company avoids sending partially loaded trucks, and maximizes the efficiency of loading. Sometimes it's more efficient to send a partially loaded truck by weight because it's full by volume, or by load bed area. (some loads can't be stacked)  


Similarly, most freight companies have dedicated routes for their heavy vehicles, and it's often unavoidable to send a heavy vehicle to a yard to pickup/setdown a load.  


The industry is already quite efficient in optimising loads and routes, that said, there will always be smaller players offering specialised services or competitive rates to breakup the larger giant freight companies.   


  
I'm sure there are good studies on this topic. Keen to hear from others which studies have good datasets to analyse. If I can find a good dataset to model/chart, I'll experiment.

In the logging industry, it's very common to have a 3rd axle that supports the trailer when loaded.  It's unclear why they don't require more axles to reduce damage.

Autonomous trucking will certainly remove a lot of potential reasons not to limit trucks to say 50k gross tons.  Very interesting point. In general this is a great example of how there are so many side-effects (both positive and negative) of new technologies and how hard this makes it to predict what will happen in the future.  For example, if it was cost-effective to replace a large semi with several small self-driving containers, those smaller containers could be utilized for more purposes.  One night they could be used in tandem for hauling large shipments long distances, and another day one could be used by itself for a small local haul between residential neighborhoods.  Or maybe someone could even afford to rent one to sleep in while it drives them from one city to another overnight.  Maybe this specific example isn't possible, but there certainly will be many big hard-to-predict changes that indirectly relate to self-driving technology (just like there were so many hard-to-predict changes related to the invention of the automobile itself). Goods aren’t going to move themselves. What else would you use our transportation network for? Due to limited power range pretty sure we'd be seeing a lot of semi trucks. When it comes to delivery groceries, pizza, and similar items, it's okay but what about moving a heap load of wood from one city to another?","Self-Driving and size/weight of trucks I was reading about how the damage to roads is the wheel weight to the power of 4 and it made me think, once we have reliable self-driving vehicles, would it still make send to use 53' 80k pounds semis?

Yes I know, only in chandler, only 10 cars, and with safety drivers. But there’s still a safety driver... bummer I'm surprised by this. I thought Google would just make Waymo an option on their Google Maps app, instead of Uber. I don't think it's explicitly mentioned in the article, but given that it's only 10 cars, I would expect that this isn't going to be available to the entirety of Lyft's user base in the service area. I think it will most likely be a ramp-up, like the Early Riders programme and Waymo One are.

Start with 10 cars and a cohort of Lyft riders, and ramping up users & cars based on the outcome of that cohort. I still don't understand this, but maybe this theory makes sense...

Waymo can easily make an app and had thousands of people sign up for the beta on the first day. We know they are not demand constrained.

Some are speculating (even insiders) that Waymo wants to have drivers in the cars for some time for safety purposes. We know the expense is minimal (relatively) when there are paid rides and a bad accident could ruin the multi billion dollar business.

Every other business is having trouble finding employees right now. If Waymo already is having trouble finding drivers and the plant is going to ramp in a few months, Waymo is driver constrained.

Maybe Waymo plans on getting Lyft drivers to use the vans? The Lyft drivers wouldn't have the huge fuel and vehicle expenses they do now with a free vehicle to use. Waymo would get free safety drivers and just need to pay for the vans, fuel, cleaning, and driver training. Everyone benefits and new corner cases can be found for the simulator while Waymo gets more confidence in their models and doesn't have as much risk to their multi hundred billion dollar business. Anyone know the rate that the safety driver has to take control?

These conditions are so tightly controlled I'm wondering if they have only solved the short tail of FSD. Curious what safeguards are built in to deter hackers from seizing control of the vehicle. Waymo is most probably going to supply cars to Lyft and compete with it at the same time.  Waymo business model might be to supply hailing companies with complete cars with AV tech already fitted. 

That's why there investing in whole factories to manufacture lidar and retrofit it to cars. 

Lyft will lease cars from the Waymo fleet for a fixed amount, lower than a human driver , which is good for them because they stop dealing with human drivers. Waymo will have the capacity to supply the  fleet + driver (the SD software) to any other company, either hailing, food delivery, supermarkets, etc. 

So waymo might have so much capacity, any mobility business will be able to rent thousands of cars at a moment's notice. The same business model behind cloud computing.

Self-driving car technology is older than the interstate highway system is today. What does that world look like?,28," Google I/O 2120: CEO John Krafcik IV announced that Waymo will be launching a driverless transportation service later this year. Soon everyone will be able to call a Waymo using the app, and a fully self-driving car will pull up with no one at the driver seat, to whisk them away to their destination. The main difference won't be human transport. It's the ability to ship stuff without drivers, everything from pizza delivery to semi-trailers. And the ability to summon vehicles rather than find parking. The transport industry as we know it is heavily focused on reducing idle time, because people want to be paid by the hour. SDCs that aren't running don't cost very much, it just needs enough business to pay for when it's actively transporting things. That will totally change the capacity planning. How unambitious.  Why is he carrying his luggage rather than giving it to a robot at his door that makes sure it gets to his hotel?   Maybe that's his carry on?   The cartoon looks like 2025 not 2120 I believe the transformation from human-driven to robots will take ten years. We're currently in this weird limbo period while Waymo is perfecting the service, which causes people to pessimistically believe will go on for decades. It won't.

&#x200B;

We are not privy to the progress being made so people think we're stuck, we're not. I was born in 1984.  I turn 70 in 2054.  I figure with the rate technological change is happening the singularity will happen in my late 50s.  Whatever that entails there is a good chance the technology will exist to enable me to be 'alive' to see 2120.    I expect life to be completely unrecognizable and more technological progress will occur over the next 100 years than occurred over the last 10,000 years.    Neanderthals may have been closer to iPhones than we are to 2120 when it comes to technology.

So how about 2040.  I will give my predicted timeline for 20 years.  Figure everything can be fudged by 1-2 years.  Which in the greater scope of thing is not very much time.

2020 -  The investment space and hype of SDC cars grows drastically.  Much like today there will be lots of of 'alllmost' moments.   There will be some display of SDC service at the Tokyo Games to showcase Japanese technology.   Waymo will clock 1B miles.

&#x200B;

2021 - Commercial SDC Taxi Service without a safety driver launches in some markets in America.   Publicly they will be fought by various people however their user base will be enthusiasts.   Groups that will openly be hostile to them will be labor unions representing drivers, car sales and support (mechanics),  political conservatives who typically hate anything new (I make this distinction because many conservatives will see this as a market triumph and a testament to American exceptionalism as this is predominately an American technology USA USA USA USA).  Me personally I anticipate the first time I will ever use a SDC without a safety driver will be 2021.   A SDC ride will cost 50-60% as much as an Uber ride does in 2019.

2022-2023 - Regulatory approval will spread very rapidly in the US.  Some places will be political holdouts but major car markets like California will not.  All SDCs in this period of time will be electric as the battery prices will drop drastically.     During this time maybe 15% of drivers will give up driving.  Resulting in 40+ million used cars entering the market.  This will cause car prices to plummet.    Babies born in 2006 would be turning 16 in 2022 will find the SDC service very popular and will not value driving to the same degree that kids did in the past, for the most part their parents will want them using a SDC service vs driving if they have the service in their area.    Struggling Shopping malls will contract with fleets for free round trips to their mall as a means of getting customers in the door.   City governments will go lax on parking requirements and developers in many big cities will be building residential towers without parking but comprehensive loading/unloading zones.  Commercial trucks will allow 1 driver to work with a convoy to lead multiple SDC trucks.  This may be legislated as a means of protecting truck driver jobs.  However the truck driver shortage will be eliminated and driver wages will drastically decline as there will be a massive surplus of truck drivers.     Taxi Drivers and Uber drivers will be greatly disrupted.  A SDC ride will cost 30% of the cost of an Uber ride in 2019.

2024-2026.  There will be massive investment of new companies in this space.    Catch up will happen very quickly.  Legacy car companies who are not becoming transportation companies will see a massive sales decline and may go out of business.   The sheer number of companies competing in this space will be comparable to the late 90s dot com bubble.   Because of all this competition the prices for service will plummet.  Some companies will give rides away in exchange for data.    The space will become over saturated and fiercely competitive.        Battery technology will be $50 per KWH so a battery good for 250 miles will cost under $4000.).   All of the lidar, cameras, sensors, and computational power that is required to do this will cost 1/10th as much as it does right now.   Fleet companies will be paying less than $20k for a car that does 1 million miles of service.  Cleaning it will be a major daily expense.   Solar will likely be 1/2th of 2019 prices so fleets will have their cars charged locally with on site solar.   Because of the low price of solar there will be much more of it in America.  California can expect to see 10x as much solar as currently exists today.   The oil industry will be greatly disrupted and the drop in demand will result in massive disruption in communities based around oil extraction.   Boom towns will become ghost towns.    Kids will see gas powered cars as old and impractical.  Especially kids who live in cities.  There will be cases where the user cost for rides will be zero.  Malls, Movie Theaters,  and Restaurants will offer free rides to get customers to come in.  Employers will start offering complimentary SDC service to their employees to get round trip commutes covered.    A SDC Ride will cost 20% the cost of an Uber ride does in 2019.

2027.-2029  There will be a SDC bust.   .  The over saturated marketplace that has been a big dog pile of competition will contract.  The result will be that numerous SDC companies will go out of business and will get bought out by other companies.   This may happen a bit earlier but it will likely be affiliated with an economic recession.   Investors will lose money.  Companies will go out of business.  Some people, dumb people, will think this will be the end of the SDC and transportation as a service.  However comparable crashes will have been the Video Game Crash of 1983, where the video game companies went belly up, but by Christmas 1985 we had the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.   Also similar to the Dot-Com crash of 2000, which didn't end the internet, the big players came around after the fact.   After all the chaos is over there will be a few companies standing.   These will be the winners.    Cities around the world will be phasing out drivers because of the massive economic inefficiency that is traffic.   Buses and street cars will no longer exist as a viable form of mass transit.  Legacy subway systems will still exist though.   Pedestrian bridges will start to become more common so people may have a large area where they can safely walk or ride a bike without having to deal with the cars.  Think the High Line in NYC.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line)   Cities will become drastically more dense as parking requirements are eliminated.  Obtaining a driver's license in California will be very difficult and drivers will need to carry a $1M policy.  Gasoline will be severely taxed.   Gas stations will also be closed in mass.  Other than super rare museum worthy collector cars, gas cars will be worthless and most of the time you will have to pay someone to take if off your hands.   Even classic cars where tens of millions of them were produced most will not have anyone wanting to buy them.   A SDC ride will cost 1/10th the cost of an Uber ride in 2019.

2030:  Its over. Outside of rural areas human driving will mostly not be allowed.    Much in the same way kids today can't believe how much long distance voice service was in the 90s, people will sort of jokingly think that it was crazy how driving was and how much people used to spend on it, especially parking!   Older generations will feel nostalgic.   Because of sophisticated fleet management systems traffic will be greatly mitigated.    Compared to today, it will be very cheap to get around.  No longer will lower income people have the financial worry of transportation.    New homes will not have garages and people will opt for more living space.  It will be very common for existing homes to turn their garage space into living space.  Especially in places where real estate is at a premium.   It will be common knowledge that AI is better at driving than humans in all conditions.

2030s -  Everything keeps improving, and every trend gets stronger.  Cities prioritize fleet service as the way goods and people get around  Street crossing in some downtown areas will be prohibited (people will use the bridges) because it may negatively affect the flow of cars.  AI will compete against humans in various forms of racing and will eventually dominate.    Freeways will allow cars to travel drastically faster, 120mph average speed may be totally reasonable in a lot of places.  ICE cars will only exist as museum pieces.  If there are 10,000 ICE Car museums in the world and they each have 500 cars then there will only be museum demand for 500k ICE cars between the 1890s and 2020.  There are over 5 million collector cars in the US.   Far too many to really be scarce and historical artifacts of a time gone by.   The vast majority of them will be junked and only the best specimens with an interesting history will be kept in special museums.  The junking process however will detail every measurement and detail about them so they will be 100% authentically replicated in hyper realistic VR simulations.

&#x200B;

2040:  It will have been 15 years since the majority of Americans have driven a car for any reason.  People under the age of 30 will likely have NEVER driven a car.   Smog, traffic, accidents, and fatalities will be very rare. This Medium article I wrote back in January 2017 only contemplates up to the end of 21st century, but it’s fairly on point:

[This is the end game for autonomous cars](https://link.medium.com/Lr7iwLSOCW) No streetlights?

I'm sure by then vehicles will be able to sense one another from at least a mile away and adjust speed accordingly when they all reach an intersection. Humans probably won’t be here Probably, something like [this](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/09/rising-seas-ice-melt-new-shoreline-maps/). That's a long time from now.  I anticipate a sub-human-level AGI (meaning it has capabilities like the type of adaptive/general agency that animals have but are missing from our narrow AI systems) before 2025 (possibly within just a couple of years) and a human-level AGI by 2028. Artificial super-intelligence by 2031.  

I speculate further that artificial super-intelligence will propagate around the earth within a few years of appearing.  I also believe that it will not immediately become orders of magnitude smart than humans, because I think it will take some time to progress and also because I believe there are limits to intelligence.  However I do think that it could be several times smarter than any person.  That will be mitigated somewhat by AI augmentation of humans via brain computer interfaces.

AIs may often have no real need for physical transport, since they can travel virtually instantly in two ways.  One, they may stream sensory input and motor output to and from remote bodies.  Or two, they can upload their current mental state to a remote body.  There may even be something like an rsync for artificial minds so that they only need to do an incremental update if they have visited that place before.

It's questionable how long unaugmented humans will stay relevant.  However, there will probably be a period where humans are relevant but they have a vastly decreased need for transport.  Virtual reality, robotic delivery, and other forms of telepresence will become much more common, as telerobotics advances to make this practical for more jobs, and as normal office work finally realizes what God awful waste of time commuting is for everyone and learns how to internet.

Modular smart city designs of the future also come into play over that time frame.  Imagine a modular multi-level city block design where all infrastructure is available for each section and level, including transport.  There could be very fast door-to-door automated transport between different parts of the city on different levels.  This might even operate like elevators that go horizontal in addition to vertical.  Many novel designs may be possible with modular smart cities.  That of course applies more to humans.

Artificial super-intelligence may choose to spend most time in fully virtual simulated worlds which will allow them to teleport instantly.  There may also be some types of AIs that do not experience consciousness in terms of a single relevant place and time the way humans do. Knowing how to drive a car will be as rare as knowing how to ride a horse and regularly riding one. >Teardrop-shaped streamlined design

Nothing to do with SDCs. Could have been done 10 years ago. Instead, companies are back to building boxes.

[https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-lidar-sensors-spotted-testing-palo-alto/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-lidar-sensors-spotted-testing-palo-alto/)

There are many more pictures available showing Tesla has tested it.  This could at least make it difficult to refute their assertions without seeing their data. Silly article.  No one questions why Tesla has more cars on the road getting way more useful data for their needs than anyone else.  LIDAR is just a temporary crutch and costs a lot at scale.  The fact they can put their full suite of sensors into every car made, whether or not the customer pays for the technology, allows them to constantly pull in data.  This puts them much much farther ahead of the completion.   Data is obviously the key to training neural nets.   If Tesla or any company has to pay for LIDAR the cost would be much higher.   People seem to dismiss the reasoning behind their well thought out approach. Three years ago when Tesla began design off their new chip and computer they had to decide what sensors it would interface with.  They chose only the existing sensors on Tesla cars. All current Tesla cars and all of the cars they will build in the near future are incompatible with LIDAR.  They have no input for the sensors. This is why Elon is anti-LIDAR.  He made his bed three years ago and is stuck with the decision.  That is also why his anti-LIDAR arguments about cost also sound three years old. He whiffed. Like a TV without an HDMI port, his cars will be out of date when self driving is a reality. I am a Tesla fan and autonomous vehicle advocate, but agree with the author that Elon and Andrej are taking a huge gamble by optimizing for cost this early in the game while human lives are on the line.

I'm pretty impressed by some of the cars in the darpa challenge video.. I remember being around 8 when I first heard about this competition, and even then when I heard that maybe one day self-driving cars will be on the road. Even then I thought ""yeah maybe in 30 years"", but just a month before my 14th birthday Tesla autopilot made its debut. I almost joined a team that was going to compete. i ended up leaving because of some other circumstances How much have things progressed from 5 years ago though?

Musk's management style reminds me of Steve Jobs when he was leading a big new product in development (Lisa, Mac, iPhone). He asks so much of his employees, and often the directives seem impossible but he keeps pushing and pushing people to their limit and it causes high turnover. Is this management style sustainable? Is the high turnover rate a cause for concern, or are the people who leave easily replaceable? This is great on two fronts. One, he will absolutely push the team towards the eventual goal. Two, I am not on that team so can watch the carnage from the outside :) Any idea how big the autopilot team is? I've worked in software a lot. Hearing this is really scary.  As Elon continues the beatings until morale improves, the quality of the autopilot code could take a nosedive at any time, and multiple times as well.  When your car updates in the coming months, test it on roads with little traffic before using it elsewhere... Tesla isn't going to find any shortcuts against the other self-driving cars and hype isn't reality. Leveraging Elon's cult of personality combined with the hype of SDCs to try to support Tesla's faltering stock. 

Sounds like the rumours that the price getting very close to the point where it will incur a margin call are true. Seems like this product is about 6 months from being done yeah? He can't find anyone to sign off on it (because it's not safe and every autonomy expert knows that) so he, an egotistical physicist, is going to head the team and force it through himself. There will likely be consequences. In other words AP guys tell Elon to pound sand. Dear lord this could be bad. Not sure what this means but it’s NOT a good look for the company.

\- Your editing presents Tesla's FSD computer as a solution to the problem of Uber hitting a pedestrian even while using lidar. These are actually totally unrelated, but your viewers will think Tesla somehow fixed everything with a new circuit board.

\- You cast the problem of improving self-driving cars as one of increasing computing capacity, which is a narrative that only Tesla pushes. It's not true. If computing capacity were the problem, people would fill half a semi-truck trailer with datacenter-scale computers and make the truck autonomous today. Even with half the cargo capacity, it would still be hugely profitable.

\- You focus on safety, yet mostly talk about Tesla, which is among the least-safe competitors. MIT recently estimated 9.2 miles per disengagement, which is abysmal. You ignore all of the other players who have systems that are multiple orders of magnitude safer. You do this because talking about Tesla brings you clicks and money, which you have admitted already.

\- You never mention that your charts could be incomplete, or might lack a critical dimension (i.e. recall). This is because you're not qualified to make such arguments, and you didn't consult anyone who was. You copied biased information and amplified it with tremendous confidence.

\- Your whole video is basically an exercise in confirmation bias. You went out and found a bunch of clips that fit the narrative you wanted. You're not even aware of what you missed. You're not an unbiased researcher, you're a kid making YouTube videos for money.

\- You presented a NYT article from nearly four years ago as your evidence that SDCs have trouble with four-way stops. That was laughable even back then, and it is not even remotely a problem that troubles SDCs today. Apparently an entire cottage industry of amateur video makers has sprung up to repeat Elon’s talking points and collect clicks. I assume this is a lucrative business model.

The author seems to make the argument that Uber uses lidar, Uber killed someone, so lidar doesn’t work.... which is a total non-sequitur.

The author made fancy charts comparing camera, radar and lidar, but failed to include the only interesting metric: recall. The primary advantage of lidar is that it offers ~100% recall. If there's an object in the path of the car, lidar will essentially always detect it. It does not require a deep net or billions of miles of weird training examples. It does not require Elon Musk to wink and promise it’ll work soon — “you’ll see!” No, lidar makes a physical measurement of the space, and it already works. 

Also, anyone who tells you 4-way stops are a big challenge for self-driving cars is not a professional in the space.

This video will probably convince thousands of other people of these falsehoods, though. This cottage industry of copycats is dangerous. Not one mention of Waymo. Hmm. He seems to be subscribing to Elon's vision of no lidar. And he mentions that Tesla's billion+ miles number makes it better than the millions done by other AV companies. Nice video. Thanks for making this. With regard to programming the car how to drive (i.e. the path planning/driving policy part of the problem, as opposed to computer vision or behaviour prediction), companies working on autonomous vehicles are beginning to incorporate [imitation learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Robot_learning_by_demonstration) and [reinforcement learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning). 

As Andrej Karpathy talked about on Tesla Autonomy Day, Tesla’s AI team used imitation learning to help Autopilot handle highway cloverleafs. That’s something Tesla drivers are using right now. 

Waymo’s head of research, Drago Anguelov, appears to be a fan of imitation learning. He gave [a talk](https://youtu.be/Q0nGo2-y0xY) where he discussed what Waymo is doing with imitation learning, although it wasn’t 100% clear to me what’s experimental and what’s being used in Waymo One vehicles today. 

Mobileye seems to be [going all-in](https://youtu.be/Q0nGo2-y0xY) on reinforcement learning, with policies that (as I understand it) are initialized with imitation learning. 

Jeff Schneider, a robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon and a former engineering lead at Uber ATG, gave [a talk](https://youtu.be/jTio_MPQRYc?t=59m50s) where he argued autonomous vehicle engineers need to explore ideas like imitation learning and reinforcement learning. I don’t know if Uber ATG is actively working on these techniques, but that seems like a good guess given Schneider’s opinion on the matter. Schneider said that Uber had even experimented with [end-to-end imitation learning](https://gradientdescent.co/t/waymo-s-imitation-learning-network-chauffeurnet-test-results/93/5?u=strangecosmos) for about a year before dropping the program. 

A small startup in the UK called Wayve is working on [end-to-end imitation learning](https://wayve.ai/blog/driving-like-human) and end-to-end reinforcement learning, but they’re a small company with little progress to show so far. They are on the extreme end of things, whereas Waymo, Mobileye, Tesla, and possibly Uber ATG are incorporating [mid-to-mid](https://gradientdescent.co/t/waymo-s-imitation-learning-network-chauffeurnet-test-results/93/5?u=strangecosmos) imitation learning and/or reinforcement learning into their systems, combined with traditional hand programming. 

I think this is important because I worry that, without machine learning, programming a car how to drive might be intractable. If engineers have to “analytically decompose and manually program a desired behavior” (as Scholarpedia puts it), across all of driving, that might just be a problem that can’t practically be solved in a reasonable amount of time, with a reasonable labour investment. There aren’t many examples I’m aware of where complex robotics tasks were solved without machine learning, or proxies for complex robotics tasks like complex video games. 

When Waymo started in 2009, the approach they were taking was intractable. That was before the popularization of deep learning in 2012. The pre-deep learning version of Waymo’s pedestrian detection software was only [1% as accurate](https://medium.com/waymo/google-i-o-recap-turning-self-driving-cars-from-science-fiction-into-reality-with-the-help-of-ai-89dded40c63) as the first deep learning version. Even now pedestrian detection isn’t a solved problem using deep learning, so it probably just wasn’t solvable with pre-deep learning technology that was only 1% as good. If deep learning hadn’t been popularized, the Google self-driving car program might have been shut down by now. It’s by luck that didn’t happen.

Analogously, I think the hand programming approach to path planning/driving policy might just be intractable. Just as we had to apply deep learning to computer vision to even get close to a solution, I think we may have to apply deep learning to path planning/driving policy as well. I feel the need to mention this - I was not a part of the making of this video in any way, shape or form. I only shared it because despite it being interesting, it also felt controversial.",The Challenge of Building a Self-Driving Car

Musk is betting that vision will get better before lidar gets cheaper. A company like Waymo can afford to try both. Paywall on the article. I find this too and fro about Lidar annoying. Technically I would bet cameras will work in the future, but it will be further off than those using Lidar. 

Also what is the target here, to be a bit safer than humans, or a lot safer than humans. The more types of data that you have the safer you can potentially make the car. Does anyone remember that test video that google showed where a guy came from nowhere on a black bike wearing black clothing. Lidar picked him up before he was even visible.


Studies reckon that automated cars need to be 5-10x safer than a human for mainstream acceptance. If an extra sensor can stop even a fraction of a percent of accidents that will be lives saved. So for me $500 is tiny to pay to save lives and get this technology mainstream, which will save huge numbers of accidents and people. The space business is kinda risky too. I will not bet against Elon. THAT has proven to be risky. > On Wednesday at an event for Google's developer's conference conference, I/O, Waymo's Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov said that Musk's decision to use only cameras and leave out lidar was ""very risky."" Lidar continuously bounces light waves around to help the car measure distances and ""see"" what's around it.

Is there a video of this? The only video I can from Google I/O is with Mayank Bansal where he talks about teaching a car to drive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxqdVO462HU Here is thought from lex on this
 https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1126207997175316484?s=20 For me what this is ultimately about the business models and liability.  If Ford offers to sell you a car and they say ""for only ten thousand dollars extra you can have auto-stop (c)"" you are going to say no, and Ford isn't going to get sued for not forcing you to buy it.  If Tesla is running a TaaS business with vehicles they own and they run over a baby, a jury is going to hear how much money they make and if only they had bought this extra safety system that baby would be alive.  

So the more sensors, the more variety of sensors, and the less some personal injury lawyer could argue that ""if only you were not trying to increase your profits little billy would still be alive"" the better.  For the cost of the extra sensors they will save these companies tons of money not just in litigation but also reputation issues.  And whatever the sensors cost its trivial on a per mile TaaS basis.",Waymo's CTO explains why Elon leaving out Lidar could be 'very risky'

But that as a basis can only train the network to be as good as a good human driver and there are plenty of limitations all humans are subject to. They stated an aim or expectation to better than any human driver.

For example, due to reaction times, the car will surely pick up on a pattern that all the human drivers training it always 'wait' some time longer than the car's own time needed to register the event and make a decision. How do they avoid it 'learning' to copy that, instead of acting as soon as it can?",SelfDrivingCars,"If Tesla's self-driving is trained by current (human) customers, how does it avoid 'learning' the limitations and faults of human drivers?",11," As stated by Kaparthy, this is not a black box neural network with video and radar in and braking and acceleration as outputs. The system has been broken into functional blocks and they train certain blocks with training data. Much of this manually reviewed by people before being put in for training. The process is much more manual than you imagine. Someday there will be self learning systems, but this is not where the technology is yet. Sometimes the technology can seem amazing or can be amazingly stupid. When it is truly smart, it will be our manager. If I understand correctly, a really simplistic over-generalization is that

1) employees at Tesla define boundaries for the car until the car learns to identify those boundaries for itself.  The car then sort of experiments with what it can do within those boundaries.

2) physics model to prevent collisions or loss of control.  Some soft boundaries, like hey don't accel/decel faster than .5g ok?

3) customers/vehicle drivers don't train the car by example. Instead they train the car in the negative, basically by saying ""No"".  

So I don't know that it actually cares about the limitations of human drivers, maybe other than what scares people or makes people uncomfortable. I don't know anything about Tesla in particular, but most of the other major self driving car companies are not using machine learning to directly imitate humans, but to learn to perceive and predict their surroundings (including other human drivers). Then they're writing software that relies on this learned perception, and maybe a few other learned but specific behaviors, to drive safely.

Again, I don't know anything about Tesla in particular, but it seems reasonable that they would do something similar: they could use the dataset gathered by their human drivers to train models of how cars behave, while not directly imitating that behavior. Instead they could write code that explicitly describes what the car should do, while possibly using learned models of human drivers to make realistic/comfortable maneuvers.

If they are doing direct imitation learning, you're right that they'd have difficulties outperforming (good, attentive) human drivers. Someone more knowledgeable will come along, but I believe humans are ""training"" through the disengagements.

Going down the freeway, there's a curve and the car starts to veer off course. Human steps in by turning the wheel to avoid the crash, and Autopilot disengages. That info is sent to Tesla and they review the situation. Maybe it turns out someone dropped a paint can on the road and it confused the AI. They look for other instances of irregular paint blotches in the database and feed it to a machine learning algorithm

Humans flag the Autopilot failure by disengaging the system in the course of normal driving. If you can determine what makes a driver good, you can exaggerate on that metric. In the simplest terms, they're not train their networks to drive so much as training them to predict what happens next. It doesn't, Tesla approach is inherently flawed.  Waymo has already came out and said this method isn't effective because the Neural Net learns bad human behavior, which effects how it will handle situations.  Instead, you need to let it learn on it's own so that it doesn't pick up bad behavior.  This means that Tesla offering will be inferior because it is always based merely on human habits, as opposed to developing better habits. First of all, it just learns something wrong if every (or atleast most) human gets it wrong. (maybe cutting corners or sth)
I think the real benefit is that it won't make mistakes like looking at a phone, being tired... and all those other human things.

edit: also, not all things are learned from humans. When to slow down/accelerate is most likely not learned from humans atm. I don't fully know the answer, they haven't said anything conclusive publicly. However, it is worth noting that an important part of driving safely is driving predictably, and so while it might be possible for an autonomous car to accelerate immediately after the car in front of you starts moving, but having a little bit of a human-like delay will probably make all of the other drivers on the road more comfortable, and so increase overall safety. I suspect that for most non-emergency situations, just because an autonomous car can in theory pull off inhuman feats of acrobatic driving doesn't mean it should. Hopefully in the decades to come, autonomous cars can gradually start getting ""better"" in a slow enough way that the expectations of human drivers and pedestrians can adapt.

One place that they mentioned in the presentation where direct machine learning from data is definitely worth it is in the problem of modelling other drivers. I wouldn't be surprised if their eventual system uses what a human would do as a starting point, then optimizes based on the expected behaviors of every other car it can see.","If Tesla's self-driving is trained by current (human) customers, how does it avoid 'learning' the limitations and faults of human drivers? On 'autonomy day' they mentioned that they have ways to identify better and worse drivers, presumably statistically breaking down the data into some measure of, e.g., how jolty or smooth the driving is. But that as a basis can only train the network to be as good as a good human driver and there are plenty of limitations all humans are subject to. They stated an aim or expectation to better than any human driver.

For example, due to reaction times, the car will surely pick up on a pattern that all the human drivers training it always 'wait' some time longer than the car's own time needed to register the event and make a decision.

My understanding is this available to all of public ? Not just Waymo one users, and you don’t need to be approved ?

I could travel to chandler  and use Lyft app and if I am very lucky, I’ll get a Waymo ride ?

Can anyone confirm they understand the same as me ? What does Waymo get out of this? They're not demand constrained.

The Lyft partnership was speculated to be the opposite. If someone wanted a ride outside of Waymo's area, a Lyft driver could handle it.

Now that Waymo is allowing the Lyft app to summon a Waymo, when Cruise or someone gets self driving working in a few years, Lyft just adds that service and forces Waymo to compete on price because Waymo put a different app between them and their users. I suppose this is progress, but what I really want to know is when they're going to pull the driver out of the vehicle. Over 1000 Waymo One users. That's news. Waymo is way ahead in the AV market in terms of their testing program and access to people who have signed up and hopefully it grows. But one thing I really don't understand is why is this happening when Lyft has its own self driving unit and working toward full autonomy (not my words, their employees LinkedIn profile says Level 5 autonomy). I don't think Waymo would buy them as it's not a good deal because Waymo has funds, app and technology. Uber's IPO is on Thurs, could this simply be Waymo throwing a little shade? >the World’s Most Experienced Driver™

>™ It seems inevitable that Waymo will eventually decide to just purchase Lyft if they really want to expand into the taxi market. I'm sure Lyft is thinking the same, hoping Waymo or Amazon buys them out. Waymo is soo sloooowww. Lyft has had some kind of self-driving partnership with another company in Las Vegas for over a year Bwahahaha. Ten cars. What happened to 82,000?

1. There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the US.  Not counting taxis, and other types of drivers, people who work in repair and maintenance and sales, and you driving yourselves. That's a great deal of labor to be saved. 
2. The SDC networks will employ hundreds of thousands of people and it will still be at least 2 orders of magnitude less labor. If I had to guess is driving related jobs go from about 30 million to 300k. 
3. SDCs will roll out market by market. Each market will have thousands of cars, they will need buildings for maintenance and repair, fleet operations personal, etc... So having some folks working on keeping the map up to date is a drop in the bucket. 
4. Also doing the HD mapping before launching in a market isn't harder than finding a space, allocating the vehicles, hiring maintenance and operations crews. Hiring and training will take months, HD map, much easier. 
5. There are 40k zip codes in the US. How many people per zip code does it take to maintain an HD map? 1, maybe less, maybe a 1/2 or a third. NYC has 145 zip codes. Do you think 145 people can't be hired to manage the NYC map? So I'd put the ceiling on map maintenance labor at 20k to 40k people. How is that not scalable? How is that less scalable than having a huge maintenance facility in every market?
6. Just to give you a comparison. Walmart has 4700 stores in the US. They manage inventory and stocking just fine. They manage a labor force of hundreds of thousands. So does amazon, home depot, Dominos pizza. Do you think SDC is a smaller opportunity than Walmart, 9% of us Retail sales? In the real world lots of business are operating at this scale. 
7. I have no answer to the question of is mapping necessary. But is it scalable? Yes, easily, laughably so. 
8. Eventually, lots of the mapping updates can be automated. That is a business optimization that won't be worth doing until you reach scale of deployment. This is the same issue with value engineering sensor suites (Lidar vs Cameras).  Lots to be done here in the 2030s.",SelfDrivingCars,Mapping is scalable,19," There's some great mobileye presentations about HD mapping. 

They suggest you can build an HD map largely automatically from cars just driving around with their EyeQ5 I think (I've not watch the talk in a while). They also suggest it takes surprisingly little data and can easily happen over mobile phone networks. 

They propose that an HD map is simply another redundant sensor for the car. If the map is slightly out of date; not a big deal, simply proceed with caution where the map doesn't match the live sensors. Additionally the map has the advantage having ""infinite"" sensor range. 

https://youtu.be/b_lBL2yhU5A 

Starting to stray into whether or not a map is required there, sorry OP, but it seems if you ask mobileye building and maintaining an HD map is fairly trivial. 

Mobileye also draw a distinction between ""map heavy"" and ""map light"", what I alluded to above they call the ""map light"" approach. I think probably a lot of the disagreement on this sub might be due to one person arguing from a map light approach and the other person assuming their talking about a map heavy approach. Typically something is considered scalable if you can increase the amount of work produced with a less than a linear amount of cost.  So if I can make a pie for $2 and I can make two pies for $3 then pie making is scalable.  Of course real world work has salability plateaus where each additional pie costs another $0.70 per pie until you can hit a threshold where you can buy bigger equipment or get better discounts.  You can actually hit points where making 10,000 pies cost more in total dollars than making 15,000 pies

Mapping has none of these qualities.  Parts of it have potential for improvement like better object recognition and automation but this applies across the board at whatever scale you are at and doesn't really make more mapping cheaper than less mapping.  The breakthroughs in the process are like buying better equipment to make pies but each additional map costs just as much as the last one.

So at any given point in time if you can do X of something for $y per item and it costs very close to $y*2 to do X\*2 then your problem isn't scalable. SDC enthusiasts pick and choose the problems they consider difficult, depending upon their preconceived narrative of which team they like best.  The result is a bunch of simultaneously-held, mutually-incompatible beliefs.

This is a great example. People believe Elon Musk will make an L5 car that can drive anywhere in any weather by next summer, but also that making/maintaining an HD map is very difficult.

The truth: a hypothetical L5 car could make an HD map just by driving around... so mapping is clearly the easier problem. Thank you sampleminded, very relevant post here.

Saying mapping doesnt scale is literally the same as saying roads dont scale.

We are paying several thousand dollars in maintenance for every mile of road yearly. Maintaining HD maps would cost a tiny fraction. Yes its laughable.

People seem to believe autonomy is just another App from silicon valley. This couldnt be more wrong. > I want this post to be the final word on why this is wrong.

What kind of attitude is this for raising something for discussion? You make some very sound points. Are you possibly underestimating the difficulty in actually keeping the maps up to date? Additionally, the ""maximum tolerance"" for error is incredibly low. Meaning that even small lapses in updates can and will cause huge problems. It's not the big sweeping changes that are the problem. It's the delay in between a change in the real world happening, and the maps being updated live on every single vehicle everywhere that relies on them.

Also, great post. :-) Every Waymo in Phoenix is verifying and updating the map everyday Oh, my sweet summer child. 

The problem is not the labor that it takes to actually modify the map. The hurdle is detecting that the map has changed without cars having problems. (because you can't risk having a fully autonomous car swerve into a wrong lane or be stuck or do anything dumb).

&#x200B;

And then even if your infrastructure is super streamlined, you still gotta record map data, which requires deploying a mapping vehicle, preferably at night to minimize occlusions, reprocessing pointcloud, redoing the labels, deploying the map to the fleet. It will take time and while you wait, the service will be disrupted and it depends how much the overall effect would be. Something like 5 blocks repainted in very strategic locations can take  down half the routable area in the city.

&#x200B;

While yeah, it is still all solvable. With the staff of about 40K-80K. It's gonna be expensive. And complicated. And since detecting the map change is a crucial part of having sustainable HD maps, it also happens to be a crucial part to avoiding severe HD map reliance.

&#x200B;

It just makes logical sense to reduce HD map reliance eventually. Which can and will be done. But it's a problem of second order, because hey, still gotta make the car drive itself even with the HD map Some Good points in this thread I want to respond to.

1. **Scalability is defined as lower cost per unit on increased volume**:  As long as unit costs don't go up with volume, and if the total number of units you need is a reasonable, then you can grow to the size you need affordably. If you want to say this isn't scalability, then fine, but that is a nit-pick.
2. **There is no possible process improvement or cost improvement from scaling mapping**: I think you can investing better software for changes and annotations, better and faster workflows, and better equipment from increased mapping volume. I'd guess collecting street view data is cheaper per-mile today than in 2008.
3. **Won't know about construction until it's too late.** Construction projects take years of planning and approvals. Their start is published before hand, often in searchable database. 
4. **Anything that needs perfect maps is too fragile to work:** I think there are many situations in which maps help, but can't be relied upon. A tree falling in the road is a good example, traffic moving around an accident might be another, none of these are on the map, they must be understood and navigated around. These are what I call level 4+ events. The cars need to handle them. Understanding the old environment is still helpful in determining the correct action in this situation. Maps will need to be annotated simply, with lower precision and higher error tolerances. Think an incident on the road changes the scoring algorithm that makes decisions. Software can rely more on sensors than map. This mode might be much more error prone in the normal situation, but is used rarely and at low speeds the car is still safe enough. A city has to be mapped once. Then every SDC using that map will update it in real time, i.e, construction zone, which will warn all other cars. My guess is human verification will rarely even be needed. The first car reports the anomaly and it's noted by the map. After the 20th car automatically reports the same anomaly the maps automatically makes the change.

But the system has learned no such thing; it doesn’t really understand what a tunnel, or what a wall is; it has just learned specific contingencies for particular scenarios. Transfer tests — in which the deep reinforcement learning system is confronted with scenarios that differ in minor ways from the one ones on which the system was trained show that deep reinforcement learning’s solutions are often extremely superficial. For example, a team of researchers at Vicarious showed that a more efficient successor technique, DeepMind’s Atari system [Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic; also known as A3C], failed on a variety of minor perturbations to Breakout (Kansky et al., 2017) from the training set, such as moving the Y coordinate (height) of the paddle, or inserting a wall midscreen. These demonstrations make clear that  it is misleading to credit deep reinforcement learning with inducing concept like wall or paddle; rather, such remarks are what comparative (animal) psychology sometimes call overattributions. It’s not that the Atari system genuinely learned a concept of wall that was robust but rather the system superficially approximated breaking through walls within a narrow set of highly trained circumstances.

This is called the ""transfer problem"" and it is likely to be the highest hurdle to clear in reaching FSD.

This is kind of misleading. Video and sensor data for all those miles is not sent to Tesla. Only a very small fraction is ever sent. When there are disengages or other odd events, it is more likely that some snipit of video and sensor data is sent. There may be some random sampling of data which is sent to expand the range of environments beyond AP navigation. They probably also store the data for later transfer by Wi-Fi since LTE traffic would be exorbitant if they had to pay for all that video traffic. We really have the perfect setup to see which approach gets you the better result.   

On one hand we have Waymo using a backing database, with LiDAR and using rules with DL together.    Waymo approach is not as cutting edge in terms of AI/ML as Tesla, IMO.   

Versus Tesla that is trying to do this with end to end neural networks.   With data coming from cameras.

In both cases the companies should have the necessary pieces needed and both have to develop the software (models) to accomplish.

My personal opinion is that it can not be done today with the Tesla approach.   We will need further breakthroughs with DNN.   

It is very different to win at Go versus driving a car.   You can make some mistakes with Go and still recover.

The big plus for Tesla is they have a lot of very eager beta users to use to train. I can conceptually see where you are coming from. But the keywords here are “may” , “might” and can that you have used. We don’t have any information on what kind of data they collect and how often they collect and how they use it.

It's not looking like EV yet due to current options/timing, so will be looking for something over 30 mpg. No plan to transition back to 2 vehicle household, especially with the cost of newer cars.

He is just intentionally letting LIDAR on the side, because he thinks there is no point in the long run.

If you look what he delivers, it is a mixed bag. The Tesla autopilot is the best driver-assist system available today, but it is not autonomous driving. He thinks he can deliver this within a year. Taking his track records in account, I doubt we will be there so rapidly.

The only company having something close to autonomous cars is Waymo in their Phoenix operation. But it is limited geographically and quite secretive. Difficult to say where the stand.

In the end what will count is who can deliver autonomous driving in most areas worldwide. Will the next iteration of the Tesla autopilot get there ? Will Waymo be able to expand to other geographies ? Is another competitor suddenly coming up ?

On another tack, I find it interesting that Mobileye has almost vanished since the divorce with Tesla. There are some interesting tech videos from them, but nothing available in a car. The Tesla autopilot, while slower than hoped, has come along quite nicely in the meantime. IMO Musk's rational against lidar applies to radar too, after all, human drivers don't have the ability to detect microwaves or see through low density obstacles, but Tesla vehicles do have radar...and sonar. 

The bottom line is, lidar was not mature when early models shipped and Tesla marketing is heavily invested in the car you bought being capable of level 4/5 autonomy so he has to take this position even though it's contrary to the design of his own product. Gotta love Musk for the pure entertainment value of his position. He's adamant. He's unequivocal. And he knows a thing or two about LiDAR. And physics. And programming. And galvanising teams to take on the improbable.

If LiDAR was as cheap as cameras would he have built it into Tesla's hardware? Perhaps.

Would you bet your house that Tesla won't be first to market with commercial FSD? I wouldn't. Can someone well versed in self driving explain why lidar is not needed? It seems like a hybrid of vision and Lidar is absolutely needed.

I am a computer engineer and from my understanding Lidar spatial analysis is actually significantly better from a security standpoint because it validates objects. Whereas camera’s dependency on visuals can be tricked. Take for example, someone erasing or drawing lines in the road. Or someone holding up a large picture of a car. 

I mean this would be serious fucking asshole move but assholes exists. Could they both be right?

I guess also both could be wrong. Not sure anyone gets the big change that will happen with automated cars....you won’t own one, you will simply order them like a taxi.  If the price per mile comes down it will become cheaper to get a taxi everywhere than own a car. Why would you pay $xx,xxx for a very expensive price of metal to sit idle 95% of the time? 

Instead there will be different car variants for different modes of operation e.g. commuter car; family car; overnight car with beds etc. It won’t make sense to own them as they will be electric and therefore if you take a long trip you will just swap cars mid-journey.

Therefore the cost of Lidar is incidental and tiny vs the business model of a car that will likely run for hundreds of thousands of miles with relatively cheap servicing - those electric motors run for a mighty long time with minimal servicing! Agree with Musk on the remarkably expensive LIDAR devices which make the car price unaffordable ([Velodyne Lidar](https://velodynelidar.com/docs/news/This%20Palm-Sized%20Laser%20Could%20Make%20Self-Driving%20Cars%20Way%20Cheaper%20_%20WIRED.pdf)).  In recent talk at TechCrunch, Anthony Levandowski, a former engineer at Waymo also mentioned the unrealistic application of LIDAR on autonomous cars.

One more point is that Tesla is proving that their cars are operating well without LIDAR and if they continue to progress in this way,  the question is: Why do we need such an super expensive device like LIDAR on autonomous cars while we have better, cheaper alternative solutions? The war is won by whomever completes the required minimum number of 9’s using the smallest wattage.

That is the deciding factor period end stop. The only factors are safety and power consumption. That’s why they have such a confident claim against the idea of using lidar.

Now with that out of the way, in my personal I option I think it’s best to air on the side of “none” when comes to products emitting anything external to themselves. There aren't many LIDAR that are ready for use on a car ( only one that I know of and it's pretty dated tech). This is probably the main reason you don't see them on Teslas. Also Elon is a know it all, so what ever he does is ""right"" and anyone using a different approach is wrong.   Here are the main benefits over a camera; LiDAR is immune to changes in ambient lighting conditions and it ""sees"" in the dark. LiDAR provides data in a very efficient way that greatly reduced the amount of compute needed to process said data ( when compared to a camera). It provides more accurate positioning data and can cover a huge FOV if mounted on the top of a car. Anyway, L5 will require a blend of tech ; IR camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS etc. Lidar doesn't work well in certain conditions... rain, fog, snow...  so Waymo can operate somewhere like Phoenix where they rarely have those conditions. And they can halt their fleet under those conditions... 

&#x200B;

Tesla is in a different position. Their fleet is already broadly distributed. For them... it is a ""fool's errand""

&#x200B;

For Waymo it might not be a fool's errand if they can get to market sooner in certain markets and certain conditions.. I mean, what if both are right? Why is one being wrong a forgone conclusion? 

Tesla largely sells cars and the taxi fleet is an idea to the side of that, where others have it reversed. Maybe a few thousands of dollars makes the difference on individual transport, but doesn't make much difference when the taxi fleet is your primary goal, and adding another 9 or a few is worth it for a large fleet. 

Maybe they both get there in the end. Convergent evolution is rife with such examples. War is quite an exaggeration, having said that I don't think there is a right or wrong perspective on sensors and design. It's simply a tradeoff. I read the article and this is an additional perspective. If your base function/product is a Computer Vision tool, obviously LIDAR is like having a jack hammer to drive a small nail. But there could be very well be a Level 5 prototype that has a sensor USP and is computationally not that intensive - a different solution to the same problem. Musk's hyperbole doesn't bother me as long as he drives competition to keep up the innovation gradient. 

P.S: Also, I wouldn't make the summary based on what Musk meant, it's not even remotely paraphrased. ""War on LIDAR""?  Lol.

&#x200B;

Can I just assume that the article is shite? Everyone knows Tesla's advantage is data, except this guy apparently.  It should have been stated LIDAR + Vision (Trained with limited data that is not statistically diverse) VS Vision (trained with 100,000 times the data that is statically diverse).

NOW if Vision is required for FSD as all seem to agree and given that the accuracy of the Vision network will be directly proportional to the volume of diverse data and the sophistication of the trainer. You can see that Tesla clearly wins. They have soo much more Vision data that the problem is actually easier to solve than the others. Furthermore they spend most of their expertise on improving Vision where all others have to fuse Vision and LIDAR networks.

It is also not as easy as he says to catch up. It will take years and $10's of billions of dollars to install and begin to capture Vision data on Tesla scale. That whole time Tesla has massive first mover advantage and continues to collect data. It is likely no other company will ever catch them on Vision data, and if that happened, Tesla would at worse be number 2. Tesla will be able to tout the number of miles their AI is trained from as a correlation to safety for years. Musk 2018 - Tesla absolutely doesn’t need capital raise. Analysts say Tesla will need capital.
Musk 2019 - Tesla raising $2B+.

It's not difficult to explain at all. Computers are imperfect and make mistakes. Just far fewer mistakes then humans make. 

Some people might have irrational difficulty in accepting that, but that's their issue to deal with. All we can really do is point out how safe the vehicles are (or will be). The only no-fault scenario I can think of is an infrastructure failure, like a roadway sign falling onto the car. In that case, the entity responsible for the infrastructure is at fault. Everything else can and should be prevented. Pure 1-party fault cases are likely much easier for SDCs, as are the cases where the SDC is mostly at fault.

The hard cases are handling humans behaving weirdly. The myth about “nothing can be done” about deer strikes is a cover-up for humans talking to each other while driving. The driver turns to face their passenger while talking, which means that for three seconds their eyes are off the road.

“Nothing can be done” is a euphemism for, “we can’t tell humans that talking to each other while driving is dangerous.”

Aside from driving at night without headlights or driving directly into the setting sun or an animal keeping pace with the A-pillar blind spot, there are very few scenarios where the human driving *actually* had no warning of the imminent collision. I think the typical rule of thumb is 10x fewer accidents and 10x fewer fatalities than humans.","Is there an acceptable at-fault accident for a self driving car?

""bring your own seat"" seems likely at first - maybe portable child seats/stroller-seats will become a thing. Or, they can just provide a seat in a locked compartment for an additional fee or something. First, this is a very good question.  Second, it has come up in the past and there is no good resolution.  A lot of people will say Taxi's won't be for families that need car seats.  Others will just say have cars with car seats in them.  Both responses sound like they come from people who have never actually dealt with car seats.  They are an absolute miserable pain in the neck.  I know families that have to buy very specific cars just because of their car seat situation.  This isn't a simple problem and anyone who thinks it is go find a family with three young kids and talk to them.

A quick car seat primer, at least in the US.  [Each state has very specific laws](https://scdps.sc.gov/buckleupsc/safety_seat_law) about how and when you can use various child restrain devices.  There is huge variation from state to state and they change all the time because more is better, right?  Most states have children under 2 must ride in rear facing full seat.  Then from two to four they must ride in a front facing full child seat. From four to eight, sometimes as old as nine, must be in a booster seat.  After that they can be in a normal seat.  Again, some states have more complex laws and some are less complex, but this is the average requirement.

So while most people think about infants in rear facing car seats, they don't think about 4th graders still needing these seats.  Most families, unless they space the children very far apart, have the ENTIRE family in seats all at the same time.  So this means that most families need 2 to 3 seats to use a taxi.  This is just an unworkable situation.  To explain why you need to understand just how crazy these seats have become.

A rear facing infant seat is an engineering feat.  Most come as two pieces plus a stroller.  The seat is detachable from a base that is permanently mounted in the car.  The same seat can latch into the car base or a stroller base.  From birth to one year of age, you never go anywhere without the seat part since it acts as a carrier, crib, etc.  Around one year of age, the child grows out of this seat and you have to buy another rear facing seat that is typically a single piece and stays in the car.  At this point you remove the child from the seat and the child walks on their own or are carried when not in the car. When they get around two, they have outgrown most rear facing seats on the market (back in 2014 anyway).  So you must buy them a front facing full harness seat.  Much like the 2nd rear facing seat, this is permanently mounted in the car and is not really detachable.

So these 3 seats from birth to 4 years of age are BIG and HEAVY and you do not want to carry them more than a dozen yards.  I helped my sister carry one two days ago and I about threw my back out as it's bulky and weighed 25lbs for my 2 year old nephew.  The other important thing to know is you really can't sit next to one.  If you have a car that will comfortably seat 3 adults on the bench, if you put one seat on the bench in the middle, you really can't get any adults to sit on that bench.  My brother-in-law died because of this fact as he tried to sit in the middle of a car seat and a booster but was unable to buckle his belt because it's physically impossible because of the size of the one car seat.  The booster isn't as bad.

Above 4 the news is a bit better.  These seats are very light, simple to use and not really a problem to stow 3-4 of them in a trunk.  They install quick and reliably and are only a pain because they are most likely useless at increasing saftey.  There are new studies that suggest a small increase in saftey but it's still very much an open question how effective they are for children above 4. This topic has come up in the past.

To respond to your question in your post title, my initial thoughts were along the lines of, “They won’t, and that’s a big deal!”

My answer today is, “They won’t (at first), but it’s not a big deal.”

They will not be practical for parents with infants, because parents are not going to want to strap their infant into a shared infant car seat. There are other practical concerns as well.

So parents with infants will not use robotaxis at first. They can continue to use their private cars. And I don’t see manually driven cars getting banned anytime in the near future (if ever), so if and when that day comes, I’m sure there will be robotaxi companies that will specialize in serving parents with infants.

PS Waymo Pacificas have convertible car seats installed in the third row today. How do Human-Taxis do it now?  (Serious question)  I would assume that large metropolitan areas where a large percentage of travel is done with taxis and Uber/Lyft have come up with this issue, and hopefully found a solution.    This is all I found quickly:   [https://babydoesnyc.com/need-car-seat-or-baby-carrier-in-nyc-cabs/](https://babydoesnyc.com/need-car-seat-or-baby-carrier-in-nyc-cabs/) How are any taxi or ride-sharing service practical for kids that need child seats? It’s not a robotaxi problem, it’s a ride-sharing problem. Foldable car seat. Small enough to fit in a bag or purse. Won't work for infants but should be ok for toddlers. They do have to test car seats before selling them so I assume they're safe (enough). Whether that's correct or not, I don't know. 

https://www.amazon.com/mifold-Grab-Booster-Seat-Slate/dp/B01H5VJJTE I’m just curious,  what do people do now when taking a taxi with a child?  I’ve never been in an Uber or hailed a taxi with a child seat. How are taxis practical for kids? How about?

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*0_foI3lja9mgvfIBoHa7cg.jpeg The obvious answer is for Waymo and others to either have vans with car seats installed and you tell them that what you need.

Alternatively, there have been cars with integrated [boosters](https://www.cars.com/articles/which-vehicles-offer-integrated-booster-seats-1420663016731/), and this would be a great use case to do more development in that area.  Consumers wouldn’t pay $2,000 for a $500 car seat built into a normal seat, but SDC companies would.

I’m certain that RECARO is already designing some options since they currently make both car seats and automotive seats.

Out of all the problems, this one is fairly easy to solve. There could also be an account option where you flag that you will need a vehicle equipped with car seat Robo taxis will be built for being just that. Which means they will have specially designed seats on which a child seat can be installed in a much easier and faster manner. Just like they will have special doors for easy access to people with disabilities.
Or they might not need seat belts and child seats at all. Have you every worn a seat belt on a bus? Families carry a more than just car seats with them. The family van is like another room of the house. People even without kids carry lots of stuff in their personal vehicles. Robo taxis might be new, but taxis are not. This isn’t a new problem, and there is likely already a “solution “","How will Robo-Taxis be practical for kids that need child seats?

Brain drain? That's not the first thing I'd fear from this headline.  Sounds like a recipe for more 'hands-off' regulation lobbying, which is probably short-sighted. Government is always well behind what is currently happening in the real world.

Watch the congressional hearings in the US and it is mindblowing how clueless our leaders are with tech. For the safety of the American public, we need to demand that accidents with and caused by SDCs are recorded and that data is accessible.

So long as we have data we can keep these companies in check.  We need to know if GM SDCs have twice as many fatal collisions as Waymo or if Zoox is doing something that should be standard in every system.

The smartest people will likely remain outside of government, because that where the most interesting and rewarding work is.

The industry will have a love/hate relationship with this data, but it’s important for the future improvement of this industry that information is made public. Well the current US administration is pretty brain dead anyway. They don't take science or ""intelligence"" seriously. So why would you stay in a place that doesn't value you? Government and these self-driving car companies need to step up and start hiring more engineers then.

>It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as ""beta"". This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed. Better blog post than I was expecting.  I think I agree wiry most of it.  I think of Auto Pilot as a collection of different pieces of software in various states of completion.

For example there are neural networks for red light and stop light detection which are actually in a best testing state.  Tesla has these NNs running to the side of the Auto Pilot NNs which are actually controlling the vehicle.  When we stop as a light that the NN thought was green for example, that discrepancy gets recorded and is potentially used to train future Auto Pilot NNs.

Overall, I think Auto Pilot is a mixed bag of features in various states of readiness. Anything we get to use to operate the vehicle autonomous has graduated to 1.0, but many of these features will need major revisions before they are ready to drive without supervision.

Granted, the front-facing cameras will be covered by the wind-shield wipers. But what about the side and rear-facing cameras? It's not unreasonable for mud and water to splash onto the lens on a rainy and windy day, especially when there are large pools of water sitting on the road.

Is this just a non-issue? Am I missing something?",SelfDrivingCars,How will Tesla achieve L4/L5 without cleaning debris from sensors?,69," It’s certainly an issue currently. I just drove through some light snow with dust last week on I80, and NoA had obvious problems from camera dirt.  The Model3 would make lane changes to pass (on the left) easily, but when changing back to the right, it would hesitate over and over (try to make the change, swerve back, repeat) with no cars in the blind spot. After being seriously annoyed, at the next stop I remembered I’d sprayed windex on the left repeater camera, but not the right.  

There exist ML algorithms to detect camera degradation (webs, water, dirt) - some businesses I’ve worked in deployed them at scale to determine which cameras, of many hundreds per building, to go clean.  But at least currently, autopilot doesn’t use this to decide whether the camera input is any good. I haven’t seen a message about it anytime recently.  Has it ever ? If Anyone can achieve a L4/L5 car, I doubt debris cleaning will be keeping them back. This is indeed an issue.  From time to time Autopilot reports its functionality is reduced due to obscured sensors.  The side and rear ones have no automatic cleaning.  If there is nobody in the vehicle, it has to hope it can travel to a place it can get cleaned.  If the blockage is serious, it may have to pull over.   If people are inside, they might have to have it pull over and then clean it.   If obscured at high speed it could be a safety issue, though most safety issues involve the front cameras. So the car notices the sensors aren't working right and tells you to clean them.  Doesn't seem like an issue to me. What about those super hydrophobic coatings that you see used on sneakers and tshirts? Not sure if it’s transparent but that, if applied every couple of months, would surely address the mud issue? It won't.  Nobody in the industry thinks that Tesla can really do L4 given with its current vehicles and sensor set. Level 5 car washes. I don’t think there are any redundancies built in either. Tesla's cars are not really intended to drive without an operator in the front seat even if the need for them to actually drive goes away.  For example, if the battery dies in a Model 3, there are no emergency release latches for the rear seats, the person in front must get out and free the people in the rear.  It's like the responsibility of the person in the exit row on an airplane so far from prohibitive, but clearly a taxi service of any type wasn't in the minds of the engineers.

Presumably, this operator would be responsible for cleaning the sensors.  I imagine the car can safely pull over with just the cameras behind the windshield and turn on the hazards. 

In terms of snow or other conditions that obscure then frequently, maybe the existing cars won't ever be able to handle those situations. It’s not really different than a human driving. The side cameras collect debris just the same as the side windows and the rear camera just like the rear window. It’s rare for these things to be bad enough to actually completely impede vision. Right now, the car plays it safe and even with slight visibility issues, disables autopilot features. The next time the car says it disabled autopilot features for visibility, do a dashcam recording and see what the car actually sees. It’ll still be able to see well enough to notice if a car is in the way for a lane change. I wonder how snow and ice will impact that. Just saw my first model 3 in Canada a few weeks ago. >Is this just a non-issue? Am I missing something?

Yes and yes. You tell the human to get out and clean them if they're too dirty to be used. https://youtu.be/zH7y0UAgDHo?t=79

In 2001 my wife had a BMW 330 CIC.   This was almost 20 years ago.

I was driving it and all of a sudden this blast of water came out of the front of the car.   I was curious what the heck and found out the car had this mechanism that would pop out every so often and clean the headlights.

This was literally almost 20 years ago.   Self driving is probably one of the hardest problems ever solved by woman/man  and cleaning something is not a very hard problem ;). They can design around it.  Perhaps something that automatically wipes it off or shoots a jet of water or air at it or something.  Or a film in front of the camera that moves to the side if its dirty and is replaced by fresh clean film.  Imagine the insides of an old film camera but with clear film that is able to move quickly. There are humans standing around everywhere.  I’m sure one of them would be willing to help out.  My car is dirtier than I’d like to admit right now. I’ve driven in snow and other less than ideal conditions, I’d imagine that this issue would happen less than you would think.

Also, Tesla can easily gather this info today, since they have 400k cars on the road.  It this is an issue they are likely already thinking about it.","How will Tesla achieve L4/L5 without cleaning debris from sensors? Given Tesla's aspirations to achieve L4/L5 with the hardware currently installed in their cars, how will they achieve this without the ability to clean debris from their camera sensors? 

Granted, the front-facing cameras will be covered by the wind-shield wipers. But what about the side and rear-facing cameras? It's not unreasonable for mud and water to splash onto the lens on a rainy and windy day, especially when there are large pools of water sitting on the road.

Is this just a non-issue? Am I missing something?"

But until then it makes much more sense to integrate these prototype systems on existing cars, since the volumes aren't there yet to justify a custom car. There have been many smaller concepts for self driving cars but IRL it is hard to just jump there....especially before real self driving active That was Weymos original plan, they continued with minivans to avoid the need to manufacture a car and at this early stage make two models work. Possible tandem seating cars: 

[Commuter Cars Tango - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuter_Cars_Tango)

or [Solo - Electra Meccanica](https://electrameccanica.com/solo/) I imagine there might be more car pooling with self driving cars which might change that number. Maybe self driving mini busses. This could be done, but there might be regulations making it harder. It would be very difficult to make a tiny one-person vehicle that passes the US crash safety ratings, for example. 

Of course laws can change, and there are lots of laws preventing certain configurations of self-driving cars - like the fact that cars must have steering wheels.

Anyway, I think most companies are focusing on the ""self-driving"" problem more than the ""most efficient use of space in a vehicle"" problem. Once we have L4/L5 fully autonomous vehicles, we'll start to see companies putting more thought into what these vehicles look like and how they're configured. 1 and 2 seaters will almost definitely be made when purpose built self driving cars are designed and manufactured. 

The efficiencies don't have to stop here either. Self driving vehicles and their riders won't care about performance so motors and power trains can be designed with small and cheap motors. Battery packs for most cars in a fleet can be limited to under 100 miles per charge. Single person ride to work and back could become very cheap soon. >I understand needing 5 seats and lots of luggage room when your car needs to be general purpose and cover corner cases - but self-driving cars don't have those restrictions 

Why don't they have such restrictions? Current self cars on the road like waymo have a lot of tech in them. Including bug heavy computers, extra sensors and batteries. So they need a bigger car with more boot space.
Assembly and Mass production of cars is a completely different problem. Just look at all the problem a new company like Tesla is facing. It's just easier to use current mass produced cheap cars to develop the tech and then build smaller cars. I have a number of articles on this.  Check out [https://ideas.4brad.com/rise-small-and-narrow-vehicle](https://ideas.4brad.com/rise-small-and-narrow-vehicle) for an other one and also my articles on robotaxi economics. It’s early days, and we need mass adoption.  Having these cars look too different than cars we feel are safe and reliable today has the potential of slowing down progress.

Even if you can prove a one seater car is vastly safer than any other car in the road, our brains are most comfortable with familiarity.

We’ll try one seaters, no seaters, and many other configurations once we have wide adoption. ...makes it cheaper to produce with less material...

Not that much cheaper.  Don't get me wrong, cheaper builds are important if you are building a physical good.  For the products we build, I have fought for and lost putting a $0.05 more expensive part on a ~$400 product because when you produce a lot of them, it adds up.  This is because that $0.05 part becomes $0.50 when you go to sell it and $0.50 * millions is money.  This isn't the case with something like an SDC.

The cost to build the eventual custom car isn't going to be so sensitive to the cost of materials, but the amount of income it can generate.  Look around at some of the small 2 seater cars that are produced today and compare them to the same quality car with 5 seats.  You will be surprised at how little money you end up saving.  That's because while making a 5 seat car is more expensive, at retail it's only a few thousand in savings.  As a taxi, those extra 3 seats can make you a lot more money.

> ..weigh less, be more energy efficient..

There isn't that much difference in the energy efficiency between a car that is even 2x heavier.  This is because weight isn't that big of a factor with rolling resistance.  Sure it uses more electricity, but not that much more and BTW, electricity is your smallest cost so it doesn't even matter.  What costs a lot of money is having excess cars doing nothing because they are a bad fit for the current demand.  I can service almost any ride with a 5 seat car, but only some rides with a 2 seat vehicle.  To deliver an average 2 minute wait for a given market I'll need a lot more cars if they are a mix of 2 and 5 seats.  They would have to be MUCH cheaper to run to justify.  The only way I see this happening is with government intervention. Right now roads are designed to accommodate cars of a certain width. It doesn't make sense to redesign for single riders until full self driving is here. This will definitely happen. Smaller vehicles will have far less impact on the environment too, both through production and in use. Long term, the engineering optimum would probably be 2 wheel self balancing vehicles.  Google ""lit motors"" for an idea of what they might look like.  So basically a battery under the floor, modest in size (30-40 kWh).  And the control axes for the SDC software would include the controls for the gyros, and both the front and rear wheels would be powered with hub motors.  And both the front and rear assemblies would be steerable as well.

&#x200B;

So it would be a vehicle that is optimal for air resistance and rolling resistance, capable of extremely high acceleration and rapid braking, and not controllable by humans as you have to control both the front and the rear steering axes.  All the SDC electronics would have been miniaturized, there would not need to be as many sensors, since the vehicle is narrower a smaller number of sensors could give it all side coverage, etc.

&#x200B;

The vehicles would be able to accomplish 'stunt' maneuvers that human driven vehicles are incapable of, though these would mainly be showcased in commercials for the vehicle in showing how they can evade most deadly crashes, being extremely narrow and extremely maneuverable. Self driving cars will eventually reduce the number of cars on the road Eventually cars will dramatically change.  But it will take some time.

But ultimately how you design a car can completely change if a human does not have to look out while driving.

If you can truly end car crashes then you can have cars that do not have all the safety that we need today.  But that is a long way off.

What is key is whoever win the robot taxi race will need to design their own cars.   It is why I was happy to see 

""Waymo is turning to Detroit to build its first self-driving car factory""

https://qz.com/1602812/waymo-is-building-a-self-driving-car-factory-in-detroit/

As a small step in the direction.   Tesla obviously is designing their own cars already.

BTW, this should also enable cars to be far cheaper to build and the with electric powering the cars and a computer driving we should get the cost per mile cheaper than today while also offering a better user experience.

Improving both is how you get rapid uptake of a new technology.","Why not make self-driving cars smaller?

Cars will not appreciate. They are machines. They depreciate. Software updates don't make old phones more valuable. There will always be better hardware coming out, and the older hardware will fall away in value as a result. That seems poorly thought out. Other OEMs are going to be releasing more self-driving options soon, and pricing is going to be competitive. If Tesla is going to artificially increase their price, they just won't be a competitive option price-wise. Tesla should **NOT** be selling a Full Self Driving option until they they can actually do this. Is it much better than the comma.ai eon? They just need to adjust the price up 1000 USD every month, for ever. They increased the price bc they realized HW3/4/5 is going to cost more, end of story. [deleted] Appreciating asset would mean they grow more valuable with time. Raising the prices one time makes for a, perhaps, one time bump to aftermarket prices, but it's never going to be like an older car is worth more than a new car - it can't appreciate in that way. After watching Autonomy Day it seems that once the regulation is here and Tesla has issued its FSD update it will be in their interest to unlock FSD so then can rent your car out under their RoboTaxi scheme. So in theory why pay when its not available. Wait and it will highly likely be at a very low cost or free if you offer your car as part of the fleet?

But here is the article.  The link was behind a PayWall.

""Elon Musk does not mince words when rejecting the technologies that other companies are relying on to control their driverless cars.

“The two main crutches that should not be used — and, in retrospect, will be obviously false and foolish — are Lidar and HD maps. Mark my words,” the Tesla chief executive said recently. 

Going against conventional wisdom and jettisoning things most of his rivals see as essential sounds risky. But Mr Musk has never been one to follow the herd, or to under-promise.

The electric car maker says its new cars already have sufficient sensors and computers to drive themselves, and that it will send out an over-the-air software update before the end of the year to complete the picture (although it might take some time before insurance companies and regulators are willing to allow the cars to be used in fully autonomous mode.)

The “crutches” that Mr Musk complained about involve two of the most common ways for autonomous vehicles to understand the world around them.

Lidar sensors, which use lasers to send out pulses of light and measure the time it takes for a reflection to come back, are currently one of the best ways to measure the shape and distance of other objects. But they are expensive, with today’s mechanical models costing several thousand dollars.

Reducing their workings to a silicon chip might help. The world has become used to the cost of silicon components like this falling rapidly over time. But big cost reductions depend on producing in large volume.


Sharp reductions in the cost of smartphone components, for instance, reflect the scale of the market, with 1.5bn handsets sold in 2018. By contrast, only around 82m cars were sold around the world last year, and it is likely to be years before a significant fraction of new vehicles are equipped to be driverless.

High-definition maps, meanwhile, are used to help driverless cars understand their surroundings, reducing the amount of raw data they need to collect and process. This makes it necessary to “geofence” them, only allowing them to travel in areas that have been very precisely mapped.

The problem with this, according to Mr Musk, is that when the real world changes in a way that is not reflected in the map, it can cause the system to fail, and if you cannot count on the map to be 100 per cent accurate, it loses its value.

Instead of techniques like these, Tesla’s autonomous driving technology relies almost entirely on teaching its cars to “see” using an array of cameras. As a back-up, its cars also use a forward-facing radar, along with a dozen ultrasonic sensors around the vehicle to help detect objects that are close by.

Improvements in computer image recognition have already been among the biggest recent advances in artificial intelligence. As with much about AI, however, tasks that seem deceptively easy for humans can floor even the best computers.

Tesla has developed a combination of hardware and software to handle the task. Two weeks ago it revealed a computer chip it designed in-house to process the massive amounts of image data needed to enable its cars to interpret their surroundings. Even Nvidia, whose chips are widely used in the AI systems in other driverless cars, credited the company with “raising the bar” for the industry.

To make sense of all the data it is processing, Tesla relies on an AI technique called deep learning. This employs artificial neural networks, systems that were originally modelled on the visual cortex of animals. 

This is where things get hard. Neural networks need large amounts of data to train on: only when they have been fed many different examples of the same thing, each painstakingly labelled by humans, can they learn enough to identity the same object in the real world.

For this, Tesla is counting on having a better real-world data set than any other company. It can draw on images captured by 400,000 or so cars that are already on the road (it hopes to get to 1m by around the middle of next year). With a piece of software it calls “shadow mode” operating in the background, it can track the behaviour of cars being driven by humans, using this to feed its learning systems.

But even this may not be enough. Neural networks are notoriously “brittle”: they can fail unexpectedly when, say, the image of an object does not match any of the variations they have been shown before. And there is always a risk that they will encounter a real-world situation they have not been trained for.

Despite this, Tesla is taking a defiantly purist approach. Feed the network enough real-world data about all the situations it could possibly encounter, it says, and the machine can match and surpass human drivers.

Tesla’s road to autonomy is full of danger
Take driving in snow, a notoriously difficult skill for driverless cars to master. Humans are surprisingly good at anticipating where lane markings are on snowy roads, says Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s head of computer vision. Feed enough human-labelled images of snowy roads into an AI system, and the computer will eventually be able to interpret a similar scene, he says.

Others in the AI world question whether it is as straightforward as this makes it sound. According to one expert who recently had a close-up view of Tesla’s AI, the technology is still far short of being able to do what Mr Musk has promised for the end of this year, although this person adds that Tesla could well reach its goal in the next two to three years.

To judge from frequent delays with other Tesla products, Mr Musk often views deadlines as moveable commitments. But if he can reach full autonomy before others using a different technology, any delays may not matter."" Behind paywall if you are not a subscriber to FT. You are welcome.

Edit: I really didn’t expect so many responses. Thank you to each one of you!",SelfDrivingCars,How do I respond to this statement?,24," Tell him [40,000 people die in car accidents](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/02/16/480956.htm) in the U.S. every year and that it's the [\#1 cause of accidental death](https://listosaur.com/miscellaneous/top-5-causes-of-accidental-death-in-the-united-states/).

SDCs *can* differentiate between pedestrians and other obstacles, and *can* reduce the number of people that needlessly die each year, and they definitely won't swerve into one obstacle just to avoid another.

These silly logic games that make it sound like computers can't make humane choices are just a distraction from the goal of improving overall safety. The SDCs also don't swerve as much as people assume. These cars have very fast reaction times, and travel at safe speeds given their visibility, traffic, and conditions. They just flat out stop in time almost always. When they can't stop in time, like in the case of the car that spun into a Waymo in Chandler, accidents happen ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxqBS2-4puw ). Let's be honest. Self driving cars are never going to be perfect. But they don't have to be. The only relevant metric is whether they're better, on average, than humans. When that happens, if we refuse to embrace self driving cars because they aren't some unobtainable degree of perfection, that will be what dooms little girls to death and hundreds of thousands of others to death. There is classification in the neural net for person and “obstacle on road”. The logic is avoid obstacle but REALLY avoid person. ""Yes, it can, and at mere fractions of the time it would take a human."" Just wait til he hears about what a train does if a child gets stuck in the track, or a bus full of orphans runs out of gas right on top of a railroad crossing!

The reason we know these aren't significant issues in practice is because trains have been in use for hundreds of years, have understood fatal error conditions, and we (as a society) accept them. [People are killed by trains all the time](https://oli.org/about-us/news/collisions-casulties). Realistically, though, as a society, we accept it.

It rarely even makes the national news when a train kills someone. Even in catastrophic situations like derailments with hazardous chemicals and hundreds of deaths, you never see people rush to microphones to claim how fundamentally problematic trains are. We understand the error conditions, we understand they're rare, and when problems do happen, we make changes to help ensure they don't happen again.

It just concerns me how dangerous/likely it is that completely irrational thinking might lead to crippling legislation that pushes self-driving cars out of our lifetimes, and we'll just have to irrationally accept the tens of thousands of deaths each year and missing out on dramatic improvements to society. All because of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It’s a hyper unrealistic situation. The car detects objects in 360 degrees, so would not swerve into something else. The car should likely just slam on the brakes. There, problem solved. 

If the brakes malfunction, we’ll, that’s a car and brake problem, not an SDC problem, and it’s a problem that applies to non-SDC’s too. ""This is a story that plays out every day on our streets, because teaching humans not to swerve in emergency situations is considered an 'advanced driving' skill. But SDCs can and must transcend this human limit to save all those little girls."" you are not allowed to swerve randomly and break the rules of the road. By the road rules, if you have an obstacle, you brake. If you drive by the rules, you will break in time. If someone jumps in front of you they are to blame. You dont blame gravity or the train for not stopping in time or not catching you when you hit the ground (for gravity). If it's engineered to do that it would do that. If it's engineered to stop and allow the user to move the object it will do that. If it's engineered to tell warm blooded things from ambient temp thing it will do that. With enough sensors it can. The more interesting question is who gets to control the software that gets to decide where it steers.  Especially where vehicle is only carrying cargo. First, yes, they absolutely can differentiate between different kinds of obstacles. Both computer vision and LiDAR should be able to no problem.

The next thing I want to add is, in the situation where the car will hit one of two things, say another car at low speed or a little girl on the side of the road. I bet you if you ran that situation with a thousand drivers, a non-trivial number of those drivers would hit the girl, killing her, instead of rear-ending the car in front of them (if swerving is the only option to avoid it). So, what are we really losing by putting the SDC in that situation? Nothing, the self-driving car could probably even do a somewhat proper analysis of the outcomes on the fly and will probably choose to rear end the other car over hitting a pedestrian more often than a human would. Yes, it can. Object detection/recognition technology is at the superhuman level and getting better and better all the time. 

The difference between human drivers and self-driving cars is that once a self-driving system makes a mistake, that's the last time it will be made by SD systems, due to the fact that they log very verbose amounts of data and it makes it easy for the engineers to pull teleremirty and fix. Ask him if he is just repeating some garbage that some industry analyst told him or some other professor or “expert” (who actually is not at all working on this tech). And he believed this person because it sounded smart and he doesn’t know any better?   Or if he knows this is the case because he is an autonomous vehicle engineer working on making these products? That's a false dichotomy.  Swerving to hit one or the other is not the only action left open to the car.  The question the car is trying to answer is not ""which one of these things to I hit?"", it is continuously trying to answer questions like, ""is it safe to proceed?"" and ""is there a safe path around these obstacles?""

Coming to a stop might not immediately occur as a solution to a speed-obsessed, self-important human driver, while remaining the first response to a system whose primary concern is not putting it into a situation where it can't avoid killing people.

How often do humans operate vehicles at speeds where the stopping distance is greater than the distance they can clearly see?  Very many human drivers do that every day.  SDC drivers are made to do that never. Even if it can't differentiate between the obstacle and the child (it can).....
If it sees two identical objects one in its path and one not in its path.. why would it choose to swerve into the one not in its path?  makes no sense.

EDIT: A lot of people have missed my point. My point is not that you can't make $30k/year with a robotaxi, you defnitely can. My point is that if anyone with real money BELIEVED you could make this much money with a Tesla, it beats every other asset class.

So for those of you who believe Elon, I encourage you to take $140k, buy four Model 3s, and then rent them out. This should give you a profit of $120k/year, which should be enough to cover your expenses and retire. If you believe him, I don't see why you'd do anything else. I'm impressed by Tesla's battery business. Very impressed. I liked Elon Musk's original masterplan to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. 

But when he bolted on self-driving to the Tesla mission, seemingly in response to the original Google Driverless car, I frowned.  Nothing I've seen since has wiped that frown off my face. It's undercooked for how overpushed it is.

Now, if you follow Tesla's finances you know they made finally profit for two quarters last year. A huge milestone for the company. However, the loss they made in the first quarter of 2019 wiped that out.

Tesla didn't count on that loss being so enormous. The company is therefore running very very low on cash. For a company, cash is like oxygen to the brain. It has to keep flowing. You only need to run out for a little while to die.

To the eye of someone who is aware of Tesla's cash situation this pitch looks a lot like an exaggeration, in order to try to keep the company alive, rather than a credible claim. Title is purposely misleading.  Their trying to make it look like Tesla is asking for $500 billion from investors.  Give the shorts something to chuckle about. I love how a guy with a company worth tens of billions is still pitching it like he’s raising a Series A round. Bezos has famously talked about the importance of keeping this “Day 1” mentality as a company grows. 👍 Lying is like breathing to Elon.

Why not include both on the cars until we know for sure?

Upon seeing Tesla’s Autonomy Day presentation, I’m starting to think Computer Vision might pan out after all. 

As someone posted earlier, the idea of being driven around freeform is a lot more appealing than driving off a database. 

My other concern is that I don’t trust legacy carmakers to keep maps up to date. Look at what a great job they do of updating maps today. You will get a pretty strong disagreement on this sub on who has the better approach.

I really hate looking at it purely using LiDAR versus using cameras.

To me it is more about driving off a database versus free form driving.  Well a name I made up but really needs a name.

IMO, this is a super hard problem and the better approach is to drive off a database to get to a point it works.

Once you have working it is a lot easier to move more and more to using the approach Tesla is taking.   So do parking lots maybe free form for example. Some thoughts:

I hate how Musk makes this an ""us vs them"" issue which radicalizes his fanbase. For example, I recently watched a Waymo presentation on YouTube, looked in the comments and there's ""Lidar is a crutch"" comment. He's basically calling everyone else in the industry stupid without any tangible evidence... this man has an enormous ego. It's impossible for me to root for someone that disrespectful.

Tesla had two options, bet on a camera-only system or give up on FSD. They can't use Lidar because of cost and aesthetics.

7 years ago, Waymo was better at self-driving than Tesla is today. They reached the milestone of handling 10 100-mile routes that were carefully selected to capture the full complexity of driving without human intervention. Tesla isn't in Musk's words ""feature-complete"" and had interventions in their short, fixed and easy route in the recent autonomy event. So their system is probably on par with Waymo's as of ~8 years ago.

People are making all kinds of overconfident assumptions but the fact is, we don't really know how these systems work. One example: we just need to throw lots of data into the neural network and that basically solves self-driving, easy! Because a self-driving system is basically a neural net, right? This is just... stupid on so many levels.

Tesla is trying to oversell the fleet-learning argument because that's the only advantage they have and the purpose of the Autonomy *Investor* Day was to convince investors and customers to give them money. But the actual usefulness of this data is simply unknown.

Also, what's the evidence that camera-only perception will have a sufficient accuracy for FSD in the near future, especially at night? ""LiDAR adds about $10,000 to the cost of the car"" is such a bad point of argument.

No shit, a sensor that requires the precise alignment of 128 lasers and 128 sensors and doesn't sell a lot of units is expensive. If/when these things are truly mass-produced by OEMs or [companies who already know how to mass-produce optical sensors](https://www.therobotreport.com/velodyne-lidar-partners-with-nikon-to-mass-produce-cheaper-lidar-sensors/), the price per unit is going to get a lot lower.

See also: basically every consumer technology. This video asserts that companies build their planning features using just machine learning, I think Tesla is the only company on record saying that's their approach. 

He then goes on to say that Tesla has the advantage because of their larger fleet, but again this assumes that everyone is using their approach which Waymo is on record saying it's not.

Lidar vs camera isn't the debate since most the big companies using lidar also use cameras. Tesla can't use lidar because it's too expensive, that is why Elon is saying it's silly now, but lidar and cameras will always be better than cameras alone.

Elon basically admitted that vision isn't solved, and that you need lidar until then. Nothing is preventing Waymo and others from dropping the lidar if vision ever gets good enough.

Tesla has already killed three people with their machine learning experiment, Waymo has caused no fatalities. Clearly Waymo's approach is the safest and the only ethically defensible one.

But you have to give it to Tesla, they have convinced their customers to not only be their safety drivers for free, they even pay a premium for it. I think showing what Tesla was able to create with the city rendering in the demo and its points about lidar being a crutch really sets the correct tone.   You can use lidar but why? Cheap solid state  LiDAR sensors will become available around 2021. Bosch is building the fab right now: [https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/bosch-invests-11-billion-double-chip-production](https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/bosch-invests-11-billion-double-chip-production) Both Tesla and Waymo have great strategies.

It’s almost certain that cameras alone will eventually be enough (that’s what humans use). So, long term, Tesla will have self driving vehicles.

But state of the art camera-based computer vision right now is not good enough. So maybd Waymo can get robotaxis onto the road sooner. They’ll be able to make money (the income Tesla claims a robotaxi generates probably covers Waymo’s sensor suite). And Waymo has cameras too! While they’re making money they can keep working on their camera based vision until they can remove LIDAR also. The problem is data gathering. Tesla's approach generates more data due to the fact that they have more cars on the road. LIDAR vs vision is not the real problem, the problem is which approach will gather the data required to train their NN fastest. Tesla appears to be more advanced in this aspect. No one has brought this up, so I will. He is incorrect about Waymo One being an automated tax service. 

Yes it uses those Chrysler Pacifica‘s, but there is a safety driver. Also, it is not open to the public, it is a closed and limited membership. Actually, as far as I can tell waymo one was simply a PR stunt, they already had a limited self driving tax service with safety drivers.

drivers. Have you ever heard about a thing called radar?
Having one in your car effectively provides you with a relatively long-range (~150m), reliable distance measurement sensor, that works in fog/rain/snow. Newer models can even provide you with several dozen locations measured (think of it as a point cloud).
Works like a charm, relatively cheap (already less than $100 per unit), proven, reliable.
LiDAR is not.
The only purpose LiDAR has currently is near-range sensing, more specifically to have some sort of ground truth. I'm surprised no one has tried to hybridize them to get the best of both worlds.

Very effective writing, Kris and Holger. Well done! I must be misunderstanding something, why can’t classification be done real time via camera, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic? And using gps/imu for localization instead of a high-def map they’re writing about in the article. The problem with maps is you constantly have to update them. You can’t drop the car anywhere and let it work. It may be fine for taxi services like Lyft and Uber, but it is not the future-proofed approach for autonomous private vehicles.

""Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers.""",130," While this is true - we are basically BETA testers - the car warns you OVER AND OVER AND OVER to keep your hands on the wheel, pay attention, and be ready to take control at any moment.  This is once you have the car and are driving it.  Their marketing would have us believe differently however I, someone currently with a learner's permit, am beta testing my human driving software on live drivers. The interesting thing is that this is not a secret nor is it illegal. In fact, to activate the settings for the autosteer or navigate on autopilot or summon mode, you need to agree to an open beta agreement and you are told by everyone from staff to other owners/drivers to the car itself to keep your hands on the wheel. It's no different as an agreement to an online game that is in open beta that you pay for. You should be aware there are issues that in fact you are likely to find that will be fixed as they are found. Those issues shouldn't *kill* you if you are using the system properly. In autopilots case, you already have control of the wheel, you tap the brake which is a direct physical circuit cut to the motors' power, and you slowdown and regain control. It does not matter what the computer of the autonomous software is communicating to the motors, power cannot be put through to the motors *physically* if you have your foot on the brake. This is FUD directed at Tesla, but it will impact all of the autonomous driving industries' customers if media outlets keep up this low-hanging fruit nonsense. Every grieving family is going to want to find someone to blame. That's absolutely understandable. I think blowing your money on legal fees is a bad way to cope but how can I judge? I'm more disgusted with the lawyers that convinced them to go through with this because if they even got moderate traction it would benefit their careers. Articles like this can set back a future that is infinitely safer because people wouldn't make predictable irrational mistakes on the road. In this man's case, his error coupled with lack of a crash attenuator on that highway (damaged from a previous crash and not dealt with by the authorities in time) caused his death and that is tragic. It's hard to swallow but this is true. Creating ""a false sense of security"" is not a crime. My chocolate lab gives me a false sense of security. I'm not going to sue a breeder if someone robs my house. Not that I think tesla is at fault, but I am interested to see what information we can learn from this. I had to go into my settings and turn on Autopilot. It's not like the car just starts driving itself with no warnings. 

Overall I think the law suit is partially justified. More so the state part. They didn't repair that barrier. Had they done that, he'd be alive My big issue with the Tesla model for development is that their beta testers (customers) aren't trained or prepared for when the car makes a mistake. A paid safety driver is trained specifically for these events, to ensure the safety of those inside and outside the car. I'd at least call it irresponsible to just let people figure it out on the fly, when it comes to re-gaining control of a vehicle at speed.

Personally, I don't love the idea of my life potentially being in the hands of someone else, when it's their first time performing a high-speed takeover in a car driving itself. I'm going to be the devil's advocate.

Yes people are agreeing to use the beta software, but they know damn well people are at risk by even offering it.

If you think Tesla is not at all at fault, you must think cigarette companies don't carry any fault either. Really would think a ""techie"" would know better. >**Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers**

Is this supposed to be some revelation? What did they think when they see the feature labeled as ""Autosteer **(BETA)**"". RIP to this guy but you have to take responsibility for the risks you take. Walter was also formerly a game programmer at Visceral Games, he worked on all of the Dead Space games. Obviously it is terminology that's tripping people up here and getting Tesla in trouble.

Tesla needs to rename it:

> Advanced Lane following

Then nobody will have anything to complain about, and Tesla can continue doing exactly what it's been doing. > Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers.

Live drivers are beta testing Tesla's Autopilot software? Maybe if the driver had his hands on the wheel and his eyes on the road and didn't trust his life with a computer, he'd still be alive. Tesla is playing a dangerous game. While traditional OEMs are taking safety-first approaches - ASIL, redundant safety concepts, etc., Tesla prioritizes functionality first. While this lets them be first to market with self-driving tech, it is a risky game, as accidents like this are much more likely to happen. And to make it worse, while they communicate the limitations of the self-driving tech clearly to individual drivers, their marketing department frequently exaggerates the capabilities of the auto-pilot.

I wouldn't be surprised to see the legislation catch up with self-driving tech, making the Tesla approach illegal for cars sold in NA/Europe. Time to go drive into a lake and blame my gps.  Anyone who expects their car to be a perfect driver in the beta phase (even though they are an imperfect human driver too) is just not being logical. Traffic deaths like these are tragic, but far less tragic than normal ones, because these people aren’t dying completely in vain, their deaths are bringing about more progress towards safer roads. What seems to be missed in the discussion is that every driver assist system today will do the same thing and most likely worse. I’m no lawyer, but I imagine it will be easy to prove that this man was explicitly made aware he is responsible for the vehicle. I also believe it will be difficult to prove he was explicitly made aware he is NOT responsible for the vehicle. If I was him I would have kept my eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. 

However, I root for Tesla, so I’m probably biased. I do wish they had driver monitoring software and forced you to keep hands on the wheel longer than 34/60 seconds. The people who have died might not have, and there might be less skepticism of SDC’s in general. They could continue refining their software while also preventing deaths, until their FSD was (if ever) ready. I believe the 3’s have driver facing cameras for future SDC fleet management, disappointing they couldn’t be used to force dangerous drivers into being more attentive.

Hopefully Tesla either makes it harder to not pay attention like this guy, or they quickly develop a FSD stack that is extremely safe.  I’m excited by Elon’s timelines, but I’m worried not meeting them will result in more ignorant, over-confidence like this case. “Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers”

This is just not true. Tesla makes you accept the “beta software terms” before you can enable this BETA feature. This is a result of negligence on multiple parties, but certainly not because Tesla is beta testing software.","The family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer killed in a fiery crash on U.S. 101, is suing Tesla over what it regards as failures and false promises of Autopilot.

You would think that if they had hit 11 million miles (or more), they would give the new figure... especially in the context of safety. It’s one of the only metrics there is, so it’s counterproductive for them to underreport that number.

Lisbon for instance would need only 26,000 of the approx. 200,000 cars that are today in this city. And they occupy a space of 210 football fields for parking. Singapore, with a very different policy, would need 1 out of 3 cars, if they were robotaxis. Anne Arbor would need 18,000 instead of 120,000 cars. NYC would need (for a coverage of 98%) only 3,000 robotaxis instead of 13,000 cabs today. Munich would reduce their fleet by over 92% from 200,000 private cars to 18,000 robotaxis.

Also consider that not more than 10% of people are actually moving during rush hour. And given that a) you can empty all those parking spaces, and have way more space - the city would feel less congested, and b) with eelectric robotaxis you can imagine new forms of vehicle sizes, such as monopods for one person only etc. [deleted] It wouldn’t, if the robotaxis don’t require carpooling. Traffic will actually get a lot worse because children will be able to order taxis to get to practice, rehearsal, school, etc. 

Everyone will still need to go places even when we don’t own cars anymore. We’ll do it then as we do it now, except with an AI driving instead of us. And with increased access to rides via smartphone, there will be many more riders on the road than currently. Depends on peak traffic and that is different in each city. Generally you would need 1/5 to 1/4 of current cars. This is a good question.  I don't have the numbers, but here's the assumptions and what I think you'd need to plug in.

You'd need enough cars to manage rush hour load.  So lets say that at 8:30 the maximum number of cars are on the road driving into the city, and at 5:30 the maximum number of cars are on the road driving out of the city.  Assuming no carpooling, that number stays the same.

However, anyone going substantially earlier, and everyone going substantially later, can reuse the same cars as before.  So if 30% of your population doesn't need to be in the office at 9am and doesn't leave at 5pm or whatever, they can use the peak commuting cars when they aren't being used.

Daytime usage for runs to the grocery store, etc, can be done with the peak cars.

Company vehicles (like what your cable guy drives) won't go away, too much equipment.

But without knowing what number of people have cars for non-peak-time commuting vs have cars for only peak-time commuting, it's hard to tell what real number the reduction will be.

Another assumption -- it will be much easier to take heavy rail if a robo taxi is cheap, because you don't have to park at the station, and taxis can be synced up to pick you up as the train arrives.  So we might see robo taxis actually cause more use of public transit. Many researchers have attempted to come up with answers.   My best guess is that at most 25% of the fleet is at use at any one time, excluding radical events like a hurricane evacuation where people would need to carpool, or cars return to pick up more people if the fleet were that small.

Of course, the cars are engineered for a number of miles, not years, so just as many cars are made.  In fact, more are made because people travel more with more convenient transportation.    Unless they carpool or you engineer them for more miles, as Tesla claims to have done. 90% of passenger miles in America will be driven by 50M SDC cars. The actual question has been addressed fairly well, but more interesting to me is a question that emerges from it...

Self driving taxis don't feel like a natural monopoly to me, or at least a market where monopolistic pressures will actually result in one...  How many major service providers are likely to exist? Obvious the more providers with small client pools the more inefficiency, but is the typical city likely to end up with 2, 3 or 10 competing service?  Similarly, what variation in service model are actually viable? The big one to me is whether a ride sharing minibus type service is actually a big enough efficiency boost (without the cost of a driver included) to be a meaningfully cheaper service than single occupancy? 27.3%, +-2% I recommend watching this playlist:

A whole new spin on training your replacement. This was the single most impressive thing they showed at the last event. FTA:

>Teams continue to hunt for the best way to prove safety. Tesla may  attempt to accumulate large numbers of shadow miles without error. Tesla  will also test by having customers use and oversee autopilot while  noting when they need to intervene, and of course, noting any  accidents.   It may be a concern that where the industry has greatly  faulted Uber for testing their system with just one poor quality safety  driver, all Tesla's beta use of autopilot with customers is done with  just one entirely untrained person.  Other teams may test by going out  with real operation, testing not just what the vehicle decides, but how  what it does affects the situation. Testing will continue on test tracks  and in simulator until the test results predict that deployment will be  sufficiently low risk. And then the real excitement begins. Tesla better hope vision running on the new hardware is enough. They have too much invested in FSD to survive if it's not.

But if it is, holy shit! Even if every other company dumped lidar and went with cameras plus radar overnight, nobody would have a fleet large enough to gather the amount of data necessary for machine learning. 

Teslas will be years ahead and they will be increasing at a faster rate than any other company. Investors will throw money at them if they can prove it works and they can build out fleets even faster which will give them more data.

If other companies stick with lidar and get that to work, they will never be able to compete on price and they won't be able to be put in consumer cars until they are much smaller and cheaper. Keep in mind that shadow miles aren't the same as real miles.

Because the algo isn't controlling the vehicle, it will never be able to make mistakes that aren't apparent until later.

The algo can only learn if it planned to do something different than what the driver did, not necessarily that what they had planned was wrong. There are a lot of benign driving options, it isn't like there is some ideal driving path. To be honest I was surprised to find out they weren't doing that all along. The reason Elon is saying Game, Set, Match is the fact is that Tesla has now the following components

1. Drivers driving the car with sensor suite and software (nn)
2. Trigger Infrastructure. Tracks what the nn did (actual/ shadow mode) and what driver did - Detect the event
3. Dojo - When an event occurs where driver takes over, it automatically tags/annotates - Tag the event
4. Rinse and repeat - March of 9's (99.9999....%)

TL;DR: manufacturer of lidar insists autonomy requires lidar, observes that Tesla doesn’t use lidar, concludes therefore Tesla isn’t autonomous. I get there is a dispute over who is right in terms of what hardware to use to make autonomous driving real. There is a difference between putting LIDAR in a test vehicle and mass producing it. Waymo has gotten the cost down but hasn’t proven it is needed to make a car autonomous. Right now Tesla is the only car company proving that Level 2, about to be Level 3, driving in many situations can be done on scale without LIDAR. Perhaps TESLA will fail because the technology is NEEDED at Level 4 autonomy. I don’t know but it is good to have different approaches to autonomous driving happening between Tesla and Waymo. Just too bad we all can’t sit back and enjoy watching the future happen. Thank you ! Velodyne president Musk has historically over-promised, but I'm inclined to side with him here. Humans don't need LIDAR to drive. Just our eyes and our brain. So why should a robot require LIDAR? Tesla's sensor array already surpasses human eyesight, and their learning algorithms are presumably processing far more training data than their competitors. At the moment she is right. But Lidar may not be a part of the solution to autonomy and that would be a problem for Velodyne. A recent [study](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/04/new-way-see-objects-accelerates-future-self-driving-cars) performed at Cornell University suggests that inexpensive cameras can rival Lidar's accuracy for a fraction of the cost. Plus, I don't think anyone wants a $10K piece of spinning hardware stuck on the roof of their car and solid state Lidar doesn't exist yet.

No. The car can't just get stuck and have no decision-making capability when it goes somewhere with no internet, such as a tunnel or the shadow of a building.

It might be more useful in restricted cases such as campus or airport shuttles: with a fixed route on private land, the operator can set up private network infrastructure and ensure there are no blackspots. The compute can be on-premises instead of in someone else's datacentre, so Internet needn't be involved at all. Outages are also less problematic in those circumstances because doing an emergency stop for no apparent reason is OK when the only traffic around is similarly controlled. But those use cases are also the easiest environment for SDCs, and typically use larger vehicles such as minibuses, so there's less motivation to take the compute out of the vehicle in those cases.

As self driving systems transition into limited use, their actual utility will come into play, and at that point their development will depend largely on the cost/utility equation.
For example - it may be found (as it was in automated subway systems) that its far cheaper and reliable to have human operators.  You have to consider all of the many functions that go into operating a transit system, then ask yourself why it is that if it still makes more sense to have humans operating vehicles literally on rails, how will it make economic sense to have FSD for vehicles with the countless potential issues of a bus? The driver is busy driving - he is not in charge of security.

You put tons of cameras inside and out. If anybody misbehaves, you prosecute them very publicly, and people will watch themselves.

Disabled? Easy: their app notifies the bus, or we subsidize their use of specialized robo-EV-taxis (cost per mile is so cheap, that's probably the easiest) Those problems you pointed out are already solved for trains. For security, there are cameras, emergency call boxes, and emergency stop buttons.

Handling wheelchairs is different for buses than trains, but many cities already have Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) that uses platforms at stops, like trains do, and the doors open just like trains so people with wheelchairs can get in and out easily.

So the people problems have already been solved for automated vehicles that are on tracks but have no drivers. I don't see how there will be problems that need new solutions when it comes to people. Honestly... this is seriously overblown.  If you're looking to fixed route bus like systems just look at Skytrain in Vancouver and the other unmanned rail operations.This is well and truly a solved problem - unmanned transit vehicles have been operating in the real world for decades.","Autonomous shuttle unexpected problems Hi,

well, no shit. I don't think anyone believes it's impossible; some simply believe it would be easier with lidar+cameras instead of cameras alone. stereoscopic cameras to measure distance is not really new not novel. This paper demonstrated the use of stereo vision to get depth out to around 30m.  That is not tremendously radical, and similar technology is already widely used in lower speed robots that only need to see out to those distances.   Cars need to see at least 100m for urban driving and 250m for high speed highway, and there is no prospect of stereo helping at those distances at present.   This paper is being wildly misinterpreted. I am still confused as to how cameras can work in varying weather conditions. Are they as effective as LiDARs at night time and in bad weather conditions like snow and heavy storm? This is getting as bad as keto vs vegan. I think Joe Rogan needs to sort all of this out for us! I don’t think it was ever a matter of impossible without Lidar. It’s just a matter of time to market. Now Musk is waiting for the software to catch up meaning he needs breakthroughs in algorithms to get him over the hump. I don’t know how effective Lidar is though but from watching Google it seems possible. I will absolutely believe that everyone is going to abandon Lidar once we have algorithmic breakthroughs. I've often said on my podcast that Elon's claim (that lidar is unnecessary) absolutely makes sense if you accept the inevitable end game of AI+camera vision, i.e., that it will be better than a human's visual cortex+eyes (aside: cf. [Aeye.ai](https://Aeye.ai)). The issue therefore is not whether camera vision will *eventually* be sufficient -- and indeed superior -- but *when* that eventuality will occur. That he claims it will occur around 2020 simply defies belief: it would be like somebody telling the Wright Brothers that in just a couple years planes would be auto-landing themselves and powered by things call jets. That said, even if Elon delivers his promise a year or two -- or even five! -- beyond what he's claiming, that will *still* beat the industry by at *least* several years, if not a decade or more, and in so doing, effectively destroy Uber, Waymo, Lift, and essentially the entire automobile and oil industries. If you can get clear visual information (from multiple cameras & their different angles) + use radar for the Non-visual. There is no need for anything else really.

Seems plausible - software will outpace hardware and be the most cost effective solution. I’ve said this at a few industry demos and had more than a few pushbacks from ‘experts’ but, we has humans don’t have a LIDAR like sensory built into us and we still drive effectively when fully alert and focused. We build our depth perception in 2D with our eyes similar to how the depth map in a Photoshop project works, so why does a self-driving system ‘have’ to have a LIDAR. I mean Radar is already giving systems such as Tesla’s a huge advantage over humans, by adding a measurable real proximity to any recognized bounding box object. The author is just another example of someone who doesn’t really get it when it comes to LiDAR.

Elon said a while ago that LiDAR is a crutch. And even the most gung ho proponents of LiDAR will agree that it is a crutch (see postscript).

Obviously driving with only two cameras is possible, because humans do it. Nobody is questioning this. The problem with that is that we don’t have a computer anywhere close to the human brain today.

So the question is, will the addition of other sensors, including LiDAR, allow a company to deploy a workable solution sooner than just waiting until compute/AI gets to the point where only cameras are necessary? 

Basically the entire industry says yes. With AutoX’s and MobilEye’s recent pivots, it seems like Tesla may be the only one who says no (someone please correct me if I’m wrong).

If the rest of the industry is right, then they will deploy before Tesla can do so.

If Tesla is right, then the advancements made in computer vision/compute will also allow the rest of the industry to eliminate LiDAR and deploy as well using cameras only. 

PS Think about what a crutch is used for. You often start on 2 crutches, then some load bearing on your injured foot/leg with 2 crutches, then down to 1 crutch, then no crutches.

The crutches allow you to get back to walking sooner compared to just letting your injury heal completely and then starting to walk again without crutches. Interesting article. You can't have object recognition and scene awareness as good as a human until you solve general AI. There is a piece of garbage on the road do I hit it or not? do I swerve, or if I can't do I hit the breaks suddenly at highway speed?  It depends on weather I can recognize a piece of the image. Even if I can't recognize what it is can I guess how hard it is by the way it's moving, or what it did to the car in-front of me?

The first generation of these cars will have lidar, and lots of redundant sensors, because ultimately we need every extra bit we can get to solve problems like these. It's easy to take sensor off. Tesla won't be first. [deleted]",On The Future of Tesla and Full Self Driving Cars

The only thing would be that you'd have to frequently move left to allow for merging in and extra slow drivers. We can.  There are more variables here than you might have considered.

&#x200B;

1. For the makers of the autonomous car, what's more valuable to them : being seen as violating all the laws, or safety?



It may be ***safer to speed****.*  The reason is that every time another human driven vehicle passes you or you pass them, each close encounter is a risk.  Each pass is a chance for a human to screw up and since they may have 20-30 mph of relative velocity to you, they might accidentally hit you at high speed.  With the high relative velocity it could shove your vehicle out of lane and cause an ultimately fatal collision. 

&#x200B;

Driving faster so that you keep up with traffic reduces relative velocity and reduces the risk of a high velocity (and thus high momentum transfer) collision.   

&#x200B;

2.  For the makers of the autonomous cars, is an occasional speeding ticket going 5-10 over all that costly?  You realize that they will have incredible advantages over regular humans.  In most places the speed limit is not enforced if you are only a few mph over the limit - but in a few corrupt rural areas, it is.  The autonomous car makers can:

a.  Mark areas on their map that have speed traps and slow down there

b.  Monitor police locations in real time - surveiling the police better than the police can surveil them back

c.  Send their high powered attorneys after corrupt rural jurisdictions. Get entire towns [dechartered](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/09/us/hampton-florida-corruption/index.html).  

&#x200B;

3.  Higher speeds also mean more miles traveled per minute which means greater revenue.  Going 70 miles per hour in a place where the highway is marked 60 is a whopping 16% faster.  In a competitive market, 16% may be the difference between making a profit and not. [deleted] The problem is that current traffic laws are made with human drivers in mind.  They set the speed limit knowing that humans aren't robots and can't keep to a specific speed.  So if they want the max speed for a road to be 60 they set the limit to 50 knowing that most drivers will try to go 55 +/- 5mph.  SDCs will obey anything you tell them to.  Today most will go 5mph over in certain situations for saftey but if Chandler told Waymo they can't go even 1mph over, they would do it.

By not allowing SDCs to break the law you are creating a 2nd class driver and favoring human driven cars.  If you allow the SDC to drive, not to the speed limit, but to the speed limit at which citations would be handed out, typically 5mph to 10mph above the limit, they can flow with almost all drivers on the road and saftey is improved. My model 3 allows me to speed by 5 mph, that's it. Though i have noticed a few short areas where nearly everyone speeds by 15+.. it lets me speed by similar amounts While it is your right to drive at the speed limit in the right lane, if only a small number of vehicles are doing it, it is disruptive to traffic and decreases overall safety.  It arguable decreases safety even for the person who wants to go slower, as vehicles must make more lane changes to get around the slower traffic and then pass it at higher speeds.

If vehicles are forced to do this, it is also unsafe, because it means that their occupants, if in a hurry, will switch to manual driving in order to drive at a faster speed, which should, in theory, be more dangerous than allowing the vehicle software to drive at that speed, if it is a speed it is rated to operate at from an engineering safety standpoint, if not a legal standpoint.

So you don't want to force vehicles down to the speed limit.   On an ideal road of N lanes, you would divide the drivers  into N groups.     For example, with 3 lanes, 3 groups, though not 3 groups of equal size, since the right lane group might be a bit smaller (to allow for easier merges) and the left lane group also a bit smaller (to allow for easier passing.)    One would have to build models to get the right ratios, and pick the right ""core speed"" for each lane, based on the desired speed of the people in that lane.

Once you know that speed -- perhaps the median of their desires -- people in that lane should travel at that speed.   They should not travel more slowly -- for that they should move right.   When they want to travel more quickly, they can either accept not to do that, or move temporarily to the left lane in order to pass.   When doing so, they must accelerate to the speed of the left lane to pass, and then return to their lane once they have done so.    

In all cases, there should be some minimum difference between the speeds of each lane.  Ie. each lane should be at least 5mph faster than the one to the right.

If one is in the left lane and a person comes up behind at a higher speed, the car in that lane should temporarily move to the right and slow down to that lane's speed, then return to the lane to the left if desiring to speed up.

This is similar to the German pattern, and it is faster and has fewer accidents. I mean, good for staying right.  But bi one drives the speed limit. What s weirdo gripe a pair of bslls.

Omg a sign! Did toy knifes the law allows toy ti speed? In PA no ticket for 4 mph over, no points if under 10 on a highway, and they aren't bothering under 15 midday places even 55 plus

Do you also drive 15 mph in neighborhoods?","Why is staying at the speed limit a problem if it simply stays in the right lane?

Or how he ditched HD maps. 

He's just saying he can get it done with what he's got. He's not denying the possibility of ever using those other technologies in support of vision in a future system. >But it seems obvious that lidar and HD maps can add value if used intelligently.

> From the paper:

>> However, to-date the main successes have been primarily in supplementing LiDAR approaches. For example, one of the leading algorithms [17] on the KITTI benchmark [12, 11] uses sensor fusion to improve the 3D average precision (AP) for cars from 66% for LiDAR to 73% with LiDAR and monocular images. In contrast, among algorithms that use only images,the state-of-the-art achieves a mere 10% AP [30]

>...

>>we achieve a 37.9% 3D AP on the validation set: almost a 300% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art image-based approach. Further, we almost halve the gap between stereo-based and LiDAR-based systems

>So this is saying: With the new techniques cited in the piper, the previous 6 fold gap between lidar + camera and stereo camera is now only a 2 fold gap.

https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bgx589/cornell_researchers_agree_with_tesla_on_not/eloxo9g/ Well, no shit. Human drivers rely on vision alone. And human eyes can't be event cameras, or assorted-pixel cameras, or multifocal, or quadrascopic, or outside the vehicle, or pointing in all directions at once. For everyone saying that humans can drive on cameras alone, keep in mind that the human brain's neural processing capability is several orders of magnitude greater than the next gen chips on the drawing board. And, it takes many years to train each one.

Of course the human brain and convolutional deepnets aren't exactly equivalent, but the general point stands. What do you trust more...a software estimating distances from images or photons reporting back precise distances ?? [deleted] >On the popular KITTI benchmark, our approach achieves impressive improvements over the existing stateof-the-art in image-based performance — raising the detection accuracy of objects within 30m range from the previous state-of-the-art of 22% to an unprecedented 74%.

I know this is just a proof of concept and that Tesla has cameras that see farther, but 30 meters is nothing of significance. Lidar companies are pushing their sensors to see (and detect) at hundreds of meters. The future of SDC sensors will probably be a combination of multiple sensors, or maybe [one sensor that can do both vision and depth internally](https://www.ouster.io/blog-posts/2018/8/31/the-camera-is-in-the-lidar)? I'm really surprised Tesla hasn't gone with a bank of 5-20 fixed laser range finders on the front of the car. scanning lidars are expensive, but a bunch mass-produced fixed range finders would be in the hundreds of dollars. then, primarily use the cameras for everything, but use the range finders and a sanity check against optical illusions. this would operate similar to the radar, but would be another redundant sanity check (to avoid mistaking a semi-truck for the horizon) I have no doubt a pair of stereoscopic cameras could some day match human visual perception. But does lidar not offer the chance to provide better than human perception? e.g. when sun is shining in camera, or at night, etc... lidar could perform better? I’m not gonna argue with a man who can land rockets, but I’ll believe it when I see it. The fact is, if we want someday to buy cheap Self Driving Cars, the better options are Cameras only, i don't know if ever Lidar will be cheap enough to be used in large scale.

Elon Musk want to sell cars, and maybe the service.

Waymo (and others) doesn't care about selling cars, they want to sell The Service, extremely big ecosystem of systems around self driving cars, so Lidar is Ok for them. I am confused. My head says Elon is wrong. My heart says, wtf - how can Elon be wrong ? Understanding this is beyond my core competency. Stupid Musk.

[deleted] How certain are we the crash was AP? I can't see AP swerving like that to the hard left while speeding up. It looked more like AP got disengaged and the driver wasn't paying enough attention, and then over corrected bigtime.

Also, in re-watching the video it appears the car accelerates around the turns - could be the car was already going too fast, though.

In my experience the AP (really the traffic aware cruise control) slows down for even the slightest turns.

I really don't think the car crashed with AP engaged the more I see it.

Edit: AP really doesn't like speeding - if you force acceleration over the threshold AP will disengage and scream at you. I wouldn't be surprised if the driver hit the accelerator going into the turn, AP disengaged from going too fast, and the driver reacted horribly. Tesla needs to watermark their videos with AP On/Off.  At least they should only suffer from the bad publicity they rightfully deserve. I’m most surprised they managed to roll a Model X. I thought that was pretty hard to do. Is it swerving around between the lanes badly or is it just me? This looks like a bad student driver. Almost drove them off a cliff, I would not use AP or any level 2 in that situation. You have to be hands on the wheel to override at any second. This is fishy as shit.

* 3rd party dashcam instead of Tesla's dashcam. I get it, I'd use a 3rd party one too, but this doesn't help the credibility of the video.
* Date in the video says 11/17/2018. Why wasn't it published then? Why published the day before the Investor Autonomy Day? Hmmm...
* YouTube channel has only one video, this one.
* No audio, no way to infer that the driver was actually paying attention or possibly doing something else. Just have to take the video publisher's word for it. And for that mater, how do we know that it was actually in autopilot??
* Video posted by a 3rd party? Doesn't appear to be posted by the owner given the video description.

Always look at things skeptically. Stupid... why is he using autopilot in a non divided highway? Note in that last section of road before the wreck, there are no street signs that point to a sharp turn. In (most) every previous turn, there were signs saying sharp right or S-curves and possibly a recommended speed. In that last straightaway, there were no signs. So I wonder if the system thought it must be mostly straight and began to build up speed, believing the lack of road ahead was the crest of a hill rather than a sharp turn, and only at the last moment realized it turned too sharply for the speed it was going.

PS: This is not any kind of excuse or anything for Tesla. Just pointing out an observation and conjecturing on what may have gone on programmatically. So, did this car have FSD hardware or software? Which brings me back to the question, why ap is not whitelisted for highways and known safe roads only... Title is more agenda pushing. He disengaged autopilot before the crash.

Edit: OP pretty much only posts negative shit about Tesla. He posted this video 5 different times all with the misleading autopilot bullshit. Disregard this troll. Very Scary... could have rolled down cliff AutoPilot does not yet decide speed. The driver selects the speed, and it looks like they were going too fast for this kind of road. Notice that 20MPH sign? Yeah.

And the driver was clearly far from alert, given that simply applying the brakes would have brought the car to a halt- especially if they were going 20MPH. At 12s into the video you can see that smoke confuses autopilot at an intersection into going the wrong way:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWaz2jer8Ek&t=12

Tesla seems to do too much stuff frame-by-frame and not take into account temporal coherence between frames. 2016 video, it’s 2019! Autopilot improves safety when monitored continuously by a human. I would not trust AP alone until multi-frame processing by the CNN is supported and shown to be safer than the current system. Then we are on a path to true self driving. Waiting with anticipation for HW3. Maybe HW4 is truly required but HW3 will make driving much safer. Never seen AP get anywhere near the port line when navigating a curve. I would need to see video of the console before I believe this was AP. That is lot of speed for auto pilot on that curve. As Tesla now dont read speed sign or have full path prediction turned on , driver is crazy here . Tesla is just advanced level 2 now. I probably would not have used AP on that kind of road... OP are you the owner of the vehicle? In fairness to Tesla, this is well beyond the envelope of what autopilot is supposed to work on and is clearly user error.  

A thousand problems with autopilot, but this isn't one. It **is** telling that the left lane line doesn't seem to even register though, it's clear the way it's interpreting road markings is incredibly limited. God why would he trust AP on that road? [removed] Regardless of whether or not it was the Tesla's fault, I think we can all agree that this wouldn't have happened to someone driving a normal car 😎 This happened when the driver turned the wheel and this disengaged the autopilot.  See the comment on the video by Jflywheel which was confirmed by the poster of the video. Thank you. I’m also unaware of what abilities that age of software was and what responsibilities the driver had with that level of autopilot. This video begs the question is Tesla’s promised hardware and software failing here and at fault or was this autopilot usage clearly outside of its designated use case?

They should get rid of the side view mirrors Musk’s timelines are always far ahead of his company’s capabilities. When I read that article my takeaway isn't that they are designing a car without a steering wheel within 2 years.  They are designing a car with a removable steering wheel that will be removed once regulators are comfortable with there not being a steering wheel.  That is a very big difference.  That means they can be easily shipping these cars within 2 years, but it might take 10 years for regulators to be comfortable so all the steering wheels just stay on. Will they still have a kill switch? Or an emergency brake in case there is an emergency situation where they need to stop/ override? Due to the excitement of the FSD demo, I turned on the auto lane change without confirmation in NoA. And decided to try to intervene as little as possible. Let’s just say it would’ve missed almost every interchange if I didn’t take over in the last few hundred feet. On top of that I look like an idiot driving with the turn signal flashing for almost a mile. I think he's publishing that rather innocuous design to push the conversation about regulation. I have strong doubts about level 5 autonomous driving being six-sigma perfect within two years. But i am absolutely certain regulations allowing for the removal of the wheel won't be generalized until much, much later. Also, it's a crappy design (side mirrors, really ?). There are much more interesting seating configurations and interior design concepts out there, from Audi, Mercedes and others. Surely the one car company that is maybe the closest to market it, has something better already lined up. They're just not showing the real deal yet. The legislation will not be an issue unless there are groups in America who politically fight it.  I expect this will actually happen as people will not want to see their jobs disappear to automation. I understand why companies are pushing development of L5, but the largest obstacle the industry is facing is the law. Current federal requirements for a vehicle include things like a steering wheel, a brake and a throttle pedal. This is why Google wasn't able to publicly deploy their no steering wheel cars for testing a few years ago. 

It's going to take years for state and federal laws to be updated to legally allow vehicles on the road without steering wheels. The federal government doesn't even know how they'll apply FMVSS testing and standards to vehicles that can't be physically driven! Like I thought.. Q1 earnings were a huge loss. Elon has redoubled his lies about how far ahead they are to cover for it. I don’t think regulation will have caught up with this in 2 years. Even if they somehow manage to get this thing produced and fully functional on time there’s no way it will be allowed on the roads. gonna need a nhtsa waiver and that will take at least two years...

Also, to take the word of Nvidia when asking ""Is Tesla's chipset really kicking the shit out of yours?"" is... flawed, let's say.

Vertical integration is a strategy that has been proven to be a successful means of quality & expense control especially for companies with a strong brands; Apple is a good analogy -- a company that only slowed down once it reached global saturation.

To say that you should take Tesla's claims with a pinch of salt is fair enough, but this article goes too far in the other direction to be reasonable.

Edit: clarification Severely slated article. Was a waste of my time reading. Dayum. I thought it would solve all problems, forever. Does this mean progress will be iterative, step-by-step? It is really interesting to watch how Nvidia is playing this.    I do think their approach is pretty smart but took me a bit to get there.

They have been praising the work that Tesla has done.    Nvidia praising helps them get other car makers going and using their chips.

I assume Nvidia made the assessment others are not also going to do their own chips.   Can't imagine a Ford for example creating their own chip.

Think going positive is a smarter approach then trying to trash Tesla. What a daft statement regarding first chip.
Of course this isn’t a first chip. Almost certainly, the asic design engineers would have made many chips in other jobs before this one. 1) The rocket analogy is bad, but  “I’ve been doing this for 30 years, and I’ve never seen a great first chip — out of anybody,” is the take-away.

2) ""Nvidia’s new Pegasus computer, says Shapiro, which has a processing speed of 320 TOPS"" which is more than Tesla's

What was unfair about the comparison is that this is a dedicated neural network chip, and he compared it to Nvidia's low end general purpose chip.    You need to compare it to other neural network chips coming out this year and next. Nvidia seems to agree that this is the best self driving chip in the world. 

[Nvidia Blog Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bgh4fa/tesla_raises_the_bar_for_selfdriving_carmakers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) They also made a chip specifically for FSD...there aren’t a lot of these applications out there right now with this approach and this much money behind it.   Most others are relying on HD maps which don’t require the same level of performance.  Better to put money else where for those and go third party. Gotta wonder if they'll find a way to make a truly massive parallel machine learning system out of all those modules they're going to be pulling out of the existing cars. I could see that going to use at the mothership data center to start learning things like people's transportation habits, so they can start working on predictive algorithms to move cars where they'll be needed once the Tesla Network goes online. I wonder if they put out a Tesla Network app, strictly to collect anonymous location data for now, if that would give them a head start on how to run the network later. Amazing presentation. It looks like Tesla is crushing the competition by a huge margin. I can't imagine they are lying about this computers performance and if it is as good as they say it's a huge step forward.

The whole fleet learning stuff is super powerful too, no one can match that. People keep referencing energy efficiency on these automotive chips. In an EV world, who cares? I mean, sure, if you're on an ICE and have a 12v battery and a small alternator to run a super computer, then yes, that might be critical, but if you're sitting on 100KWh of 400v power, losing a few miles isn't going to matter.

And Waymo still has work to do, based on the field testing in Phoenix before they remove the steering wheel/driver completely.

Tesla is aiming for ""as good as the average driver"", but full automation has to be a large factor better than the average driver because liability lies with the full automation package, not the owner.  That's also where “You all used your own neural network in your brains to get here. You didn’t shoot lasers from your eyes to drive,” as Karpathy said, fails.  [Tesla's Autonomy Day highlights Elon Musk's vision for a full self-driving future without LiDAR](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-autonomy-day-lidar/)

Tesla might be one or two litigation away from bankruptcy if they deploy ""FSD"" too soon, no matter what waiver the vehicle owner signs.  But based on their sales strategy, they're making money in the meantime on the promise by selling future ""FSD"". Could Waymo be making this problem harder than it has to be? They have dozens of cameras and lasers feeding independent streams of data to create at least 3 different ""images"" of the 3D environment. The amount of computational power needed to handle this seems like it would be a lot higher than the computational power needed for a smaller number of cameras and radars. I'm sure their argument is that for safety you need 3 different 360 degree views from lidar, radar and video....but if that turns out to be false this approach will be inherently more expensive than necessary. Interesting watching this presentation and comparing it to Tesla's Autonomy day presentation to compare the vast differences in their approaches. Both make references to learning from their fleets. The difference though is that Tesla's fleet numbers in the hundreds of thousands, in cities around the world, while Waymo's fleet is just at 100, in select US cities.

On paper, it seems like Waymo's approach will take a lot longer to scale, if they have to perform similar testing in each country or region before expanding there (as local rules and driver habits will vary from region to region).

Waymo's vehicle features also look much more obtrusive than Tesla's, with their lidar and other sensors sticking out and drawing attention to your vehicle. Perhaps other vehicles respond differently to Waymo vehicles, knowing they could be in self driving mode, than Teslas which look like traditional cars. Most people point out that Lidar can provide accurate depth of an object.

However it comes at a steep price. It is expensive, it consumes a lot of power, it shoots huge amounts of lasers in all directions and it does not work well in snow, rain, fog etc.","Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo: From Self-driving Cars to a Vision for Future Mobility "
